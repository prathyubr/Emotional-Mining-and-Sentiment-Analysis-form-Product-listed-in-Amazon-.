Parag,1,India,19-10-2018,FALSE,2248,Very poor sound recognition.,"It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad."
Chinmaya D.,5,India,15-10-2018,FALSE,2965,My first Smart Speaker,This was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English
Vishnu,5,India,22-12-2018,FALSE,962,it’s amazing just read my review,"The media could not be loaded.  Such an amazing product it responds from where ever I call it from my room . It does slow down when my data internet is over its just amazing . It does play all musics from all languages it can tell jokes ,can turn lights tv etc on or off. It can speak and understand Hindi and EnglishIt plays all songs I have tried Telugu English and HindiIt does play what ever songs you wantAnd it can roast you or your friend anyoneYou can even call through thatI just love it"
Rajiv p.,4,India,15-10-2018,FALSE,647,Stunner!,It's totally Paisa wasoolSpeaker is loudShe listen well to your commandI'm amazed with it music quality even when paired with mobile it plays loud but struggling to make a callHapppy me !
Aritra Daspoddar,4,India,19-02-2019,FALSE,233,A real competition to Google Home mini,"At first i was confused which one to buy - Google home mini or Echo dot. After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.Pros:1) Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.2) Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks. For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.3) It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.4) Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription. You can stream in Amazon prime video, music from prime music, become an Amazon prime member, free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.5) You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips, Xiaomi, Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devices.Cons:1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant, Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)2) It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered (same is the case with Google home)So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with, Google home is your choice. For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better."
CoffeeNCam,5,India,26-10-2018,FALSE,149,"Finally, a smart ""speaker""","I got it on sale for 3k. For the price, it offers decent sound and richer bass, compared to my much cheaper, 1.5k Bluetooth speaker, the Boat Stone 260. It works seemlessly with my smart home devices, and the app is fantastic. It yet doesn't have support with fire TV stick, but Amazon assures it'll arrive by mid-november, so that's something to look out for. The app works great, and you can control your smart home or this dot from anywhere in the world, as long both of your devices have an internet connection. It's a fun little party trick, really. I couldn't be more happier with my echo dot. Also, as you can see in the picture, I got the sophisticated looking white color ;)Edit: It has fire TV support now, it's not the best experience, but hey - it WORKS."
Rimple Sethi,2,India,21-10-2018,FALSE,153,Good music player but poor assistant,Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria. There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick. It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.
Kumar Gautam,1,India,13-10-2021,FALSE,71,Not satisfied with the wipro smart bulb its not changing colour.,I bought this product to gift some one else and now I come to know that the product (wipro smart bulb) is faulty its not changing color.not satisfied with this deal.
One of Amazon lover🎭,4,India,25-08-2021,FALSE,61,Good Alexa with 'incompatible' smart wipro💡,"Alexa is very good but came with defective smart bulb..., took very much time for setting and now Alexa is replying 'device is not compatible'. Now the smart bulb is working as a normal bulb of Rs. 25/-"
Amrish,1,India,15-10-2018,FALSE,128,it does not support fire TV,"This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!. So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only."
Gems,1,India,04-10-2019,FALSE,83,Google is infinitely better,"Even the best devices can be ruined by poor software and bad UI. This is a classic case of a good device such as the Echo dot 3rd gen let down by horrendous software. In terms of sheer sound quality and ability to hear you across the room, the ED 3rd blows google home mini right out of the water, and... that's where it stops.I bought it for 2299 and got a wipro bulb free, I figured that it couldn't be a bad purchase. Boy was I wrong!Let's begin with the Alexa app, whoever is in charge of making that app should be sent back to 2012. Remember when you had no clue whether you tapped on a button or not because the taps weren't highlighted? Remember how everything used to be unresponsive back then? Yeah, that's Alexa app for you. SD 855 and 8gigs of ram on your phone? LoL, Alexa don't care! The layout, the buttons in the app, the navigation, ugh.. takes me back to the 90's. A big zero on ease of use or navigational hierarchy. Forget Grandpa, even millennials would have a hard time with this app!What about voice recognition? 50% of the time, it does not recognize you every time.Smartness: The lack of smartness is displayed when you start asking follow up questions. ""Who is the tallest man?"" It'll give you the answer, but if you follow up with ""how tall is he?"". Alexa will go berserk. Heralding a device that can control your lights or turn on the TV as a miraculous achievement is a blatant lie. Controls via commands is nothing new, people in the coding community have done so with raspberry pi's before. What makes it smart is the incousion of AI and machine learning that understands patters and recognizes speech slurs. Something google does and constantly thrives to improve upon.Microphones: There are 4 and they are good, they can hear you from 10 feet away under normal circumstances. Far better than Goggle home mini.Connectivity issues: Wuff, this is one of the biggest issues I faced. Connection is not as easy and simple as that 3 slide image says on the description. Turn on Bluetooth, location, wifi, then look at the app for a Echo-something-th8, it didn't show up! Great, now do the manual labour and get it connected. Even after connection you're gonna get ""updating your device for 10 minutes"".Integration with other smart devices: Wanna connect the wipro bulb with Alexa? First download the wipro smart home app, create an account so that you can be spammed for the rest of your life, then set up that app and device. Next, head over to Alexa, download the wipro skill app for alexa, set it up and congratulations, you can now control lights with latency issues rivaling that of a 56k modem. What's worse, I now have an app on my phone that I only used once in my life but cannot for the love of god uninstall because that stops the bulb from working. VERY SMART!Music: Wanna listen to music on this speaker from your favorite streaming service? Unless it's Amazon music, Saavn or iTunes, your sh!t our of luck. Even though Spotify launched nearly a year ago, there's no way to get Spotify playing on the device natively unless you change device region to Amerika.Speed: You can stream Netflix at 4k? That's great, Alexa don't care! Ask a question, go brew a coffee, fix that leaking faucet, sign up for a banking loan and then, only then perhaps you would get your answer. Now that's an exaggeration but when you compare Alexa's speed in terms of genuine questions as opposed to responding to commands like ""turn off the light"", it is the slowest. Google>Siri>Cortana>your neighbor's pigeon >Alexa.I could go on, but I'll stop here and sulk myself with buyer's remorse."
Amazon Customer,5,India,09-08-2021,FALSE,51,Super smart speaker 🔊👏🏻👌🏻👍🏻,The media could not be loaded.  It's just amazing. I bought it for my son. And he is loving it like crazy. The perfect smart speaker with reasonable price. Must buy product if you want to buy a smart speaker. And I bought it Ina combo with light. And it's working super fine.
Sonu,5,India,13-11-2018,FALSE,104,Best at what it does..,"Presently there are two major competitors for smart speakers in India i.e., Amazon echo dot and Google home mini. I am user of both. Trust me Amazon echo has nailed their product by this 3rd generation upgrade.->Beautiful modern look with good sound and super microphone sensitivity. Google home with its 2 microphone is far behind on picking user command especially when music is on as compared to alexa(4 microphones). So hardware wise Echo dot(3rd gen) is clearly winner with louder sound, better bass and better microphone sensitivity.->Alexa response time is faster plus it hears me out in most of noisy situations. I literally have to shout to google home sometimes.->Music listening experience is breeze on alexa with prime account. Amazon music is tailored made for India having songs and playlist for festival occasions. Google music doesn't have festival playlist. Google music team doesn't pay heed to Indian festivals and occasions. I couldn't find diwali playlist on Google Music(being a pro member). Moreover Alexa is quick on catching keywords whereas Google is slow and sometimes unable to catch keywords. Moreover google home interaction with gaana and saavn is not perfect. It doesn't able to find songs many times even if song is there on Gaana(being pro user).->Google home is better for continued conversations because it knows context but I think conversation with these devices dies out after few days of excitement. And then you only use these for doing daily jobs- playing news, songs, reminders, questions and answers, alarms in which alexa is better(due to its hardware advantage). Although I wish Amazon add context conversation to Alexa along with voice profile feature(multi user voice recognition) which is present on Google home.->Google home has one major advantage that it supports hindi language(commands and response). I wish Amazon add this feature to alexa.->Lastly Alexa has vast collection of skills in India- playing radio stations, flight search and price(cleartrip integration), zomato restuarant suggestion and food ordering, ola and uber cab booking, railways pnr enquiry and train availability, hindi jokes(better than on google home), meditation, exercise, devotional songs, and many more. Google home is lacking on many of these useful skills like flight search and price, ola, uber, zomato,radio stations, train availability, etc.->Alexa integration with amazon firestick is on its way according to Alexa Indian team. So it is an useful addition of feature for those who have amazon firestick.Conclusion->If you are a prime user, Amazon echo dot is the best choice for you among all competitors. If you are buying for your family or someone else not comfortable with english, then Google home is your only choice right now(as it supports hindi language).UPDATE!!!-> Amazon has brought in much requested contextual conversation and continued conversation feature to Alexa like in Google home known as ""Follow-Up Mode"" which can be enabled from settings."
Monu,5,India,26-09-2021,FALSE,46,Very good product,Bhut hi Achha hai aur bhut achhe se kam karta hai
Sharpbhushan,5,India,10-11-2018,FALSE,95,it's a worth buying,"I bought 3rd gen Echo Dot.... here are some pros and cons:Pro's.1. Great improvement in sound quality when compared to the 2nd generation DOT.2. Alexa understands Indian accent well and the one sold here is customized only for India.3. Design and build quality is very good. I liked the fabric design over the plastic on the 2nd gen DOT4. Just say what you want to buy from Amazon and it will purchase/add it to your cart. Alexa will buy it provided you have given her permissions, it can be controlled using Alexa app on your mobile.5. You can make her connect to a bigger speaker using bluetooth or Aux for better quality sound.6. Alexa can play songs of your choice from Amazon prime music as well as Tune-in radio. You can enable other radio stations aswell.7. The best part of Alexa is that she can set reminders, to do lists and Alarms. She can set multiple alarms and reminders.8. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc.Cons.1. You need Amazon prime subscription to search and play for songs. I won't recommend Echo to anyone without Prime subscription.Over all I'm happy with Alexa. She is a good smart companion. Alexa is intelligent and there are lot of things you can do, just some spent time with her and you will be amazed. Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills, it's a worth buying....."
mohsin(Genuine Review,1,India,28-10-2018,FALSE,96,Cons,1.we have to talk nearby.2. And general skills not performing well. 3. Any thing you required you have to tell. 4 its only a machiene we cannot talk with that 5 . Every time we require high speed internet.6 if playing some thing we have to shout when we need to chane
Anoop varghese,1,India,02-12-2018,FALSE,85,Waste product,"Waste item,nothing free ,if we will ask to play one song means alexa will tell you should subscribe amazon prime.only weather will come freely.no inbuilt battery, no power means no alarm completely waste product.why you should spend money unnecessary to this waste product.they wont give at least one month free prime membership also ..."
Vikas Singh,3,India,04-08-2020,FALSE,42,Not that useful,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 years old son. Since he don't have siblings so I though it would be a fun experience for him talking to and giving commands to alexa. But to my dismay he only used it for playing music that also only one song after one month of his birthday. ""Alexa please play the flying jat song"". There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz, panchtantra ki kahaniya, alexa laugh, beatbox, fart! Etc. But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker. I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb. But after few days I started using the smart bulb as a regular bulb because it's easier to press the physical switch compared to checking the configuration & connection everytime ""Alexa Bulb on"" or ""Alexa bulb off"" voice command doesn't work. So now it is kept idle since 3 months and will remain so for many more months/years to come. The bottomline is that alexa is not that useful as advertised and we tend to lose interest in it very quickly."
Ramkumar R,5,India,07-11-2018,FALSE,69,"Bought it once, Will Buy it Again and Again","1) Firstly, you may be confused whether to buy Google Home or Alexa. If you are an Amazon Prime customer, the choice is a no-brainer because you get Amazon Music for free as well as tight integration with Amazon Products.2) The sound produced by this device is good for filling one bedroom with rich sound. Arijit Singh never sounded so deep :).3) The microphone is super sensitive. You can even whisper ""Alexa"" and the device will pick it up.4) The Alexa skills available are amazing which can be turned on through the companion app. Few skills you should try are 4.1) Radio tuning=> Just say Alexa Play Radiocity. Get back into the radio habit. 4.2) For the religious => Just say Alexa wake me up at 6 AM to Suprabhatam. Done deal. 4.3) For the romantic => Just say Alexa open Love Shayari. Ghalib at your finger tips. 4.4) Want a multiplayer quiz fight => Just say Alexa QuizMaster. You will be playing it at 10 AM. 4.5 ) Interactive Stories for Kids => Just say Alexa MagicDoor. 4.6) Apps by Magoosh to build vocabulary are awesome.5) Alexa can calculate, tell you the calories in an egg, convert feet to inches and all the regular things.6) The most useful features 6.1) Alexa add milk to shopping list. Viola! milk is added as a list item in the shopping list on your app. Very useful for my wife. 6.2) Drop In using your Alexa App to talk to people at home. Very useful.7) Setting Alexa up is a breeze and since she is cloud based the intelligence keeps improving.Alexa has thoroughly impressed my family and now everyone wants one for their room. Waiting for the next sale."
Akash Kotak,1,India,02-11-2018,FALSE,63,"Great Functionality , speaker quality is horrible","Hi The functionality of this product is awesome, only issue is the speaker quality is really bad. Within 10 days of me using it the speakers are jarring and sound is bad. I cant even get a replacement now.Spoke with Amazon customer support they said they arent the manufacturers of the Amazon Echo dot :P .. Most hilarious thing i have heard . Anyways speaker quality is bad , functionality is great ."
Shanti devarakonda,5,India,21-01-2019,FALSE,51,Beauty with beast features😍😍😍😘😘,It’s jus beyond awesome.👌🏻😍😍😍 I thought dot is bit small so the sound quality may affect due to size but really it’s really a beast. The sound system is jus beyond my expectations in one room the sound to the full volume is very loud.Pros: I have syska led smart bulb too which works wonder wid this amazon dot.It’s also works with fire tv stick.Sound quality is jus fab.Look wise it’s beautifulCan be commanded being in different room.Cons:Cannot take multiple instructions especially when u r operating wid fire stick.Please don’t take a second thought to buy this beauty.I got this for 3k in amazon great festival.
Gaurav Vats,3,India,22-11-2018,FALSE,51,"My Wife Can't Listen to me, But Alexa Can.😉","""My Wife Can't Listen to me, But Alexa Can"" The new echo dot 3rd gen is much better than previous model. I got it at 2700 after all discount and cash back which is again a steal a deal.Now after using it for 2 months, here is my genuine review which help others future buyers to decide to buy or not to buy this product.-What I like About This Product.1. Built Quality is perfect and strong.2. Sound Quality with balanced bass.3. Super Voice Detection thanks to 4 Inbuilt mic.4. Fast Bluetooth connectivity and sync. Process.5. Calling through Alexa is super fun and easy.6. Cristal clear voice quality.7. 3.5mm Audio Jack is again + for this product.8. Best ecosystem for smart home control.9. Perfectly work with all Alexa enabled device.10. Multiple Alarm, Reminder, To-Do List works perfect.11. Alexa calling is super fun and I really enjoyed this features subject to the other person having account in Alexa.12. Can create shopping list for you. But can not tell deals and promotions, so be careful and check the offers before placing the order.What I don't like.1. Not answer all the questions correctly.2. Only support English language.3. Get stuck after turning it on after a long break and I have re-start the device to make connection again which irritate a lot.4. Answer is not as clear at Google Home mini.5. Listen only clear english, so if you are Not Good in English then Alexa will irritate you a lot.Addition details:I would recommend this device to those who use Alexa enabled device in their home or office..but if you are using Google enabled device then I would not recommend this device."
Anirban Bhattacharya,5,India,20-10-2018,FALSE,51,Just awesome..am loving it,"3rd gen product is just awesome. Very much improved version...indian english accent is no longer the issue . It's skill based product and Not search based like google home , so I guess you might not get answers to all questions since the skill need to be added. I have not used Google home...not sure if it searched in google engine and find answers to all your query. Part sound quality is just awesome...you do not need a speaker to connect. Looks wise an excellent one. I am fan of it now."

BhaveshB.O.T™,4,India,21-07-2019,FALSE,27,Amazon's entry-level Echo is still one of its best 😍,"Verdict-While the previous Echo Dots were cheap ways to extend smart home control all over your home, they weren't the most attractive devices and had weedy sounds. Bought it on tha second day of Prime day in a combo-The Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) as a vast improvement on the originals, even though it costs exactly the same.-The new finish looks fantastic and the new Echo Dot is a device that you'd happily put out on show. Audio has been dramatically improved, too, both in terms of quality and loudness, which makes Alexa easier to understand and means that the odd bit of music or radio is a possibility.-If you're looking to put Alexa in more rooms, then this is the device to buy.Pros-Clear and loud audio-3.5mm and Bluetooth audio outputs-Same price as old model-Improved designCons-No longer USB-powered-Not ideal for music"
jyoti mishra,1,India,05-12-2018,FALSE,31,It is only a good hands free speaker...thats all,"Echo dot is a hands free speaker not more than that. Most of the time don't understand ur query. It do not tell u latest new(actually it not respond to news query), recepies etc. Also to listen to songs we have take prime membership of amazon. Waste of money....rather to buy a Bluetooth speaker, which includes battery also.... disappointed. I bought it as my daughter's birthday gift. Now I m trying convince her to let me return it, but c not agreeing for it bcoz so much ad is there on tv ....c thinks it's a must have Gadget and to show off her friends."
Dr. MUDHAN,5,India,22-10-2018,FALSE,33,A CHANGE IN MY LIFESTYLE,"My childhood friend and a great well-wisher Sri Radha Krishnan gifted me Rs. 3000/- and wanted me to buy anything that I like.I thought, I should buy something that is very special in my lifetime and fortunate to get a Third Gen Amazon Eco Dot at that price during Amazon Great Indian Sale.I feel, my REVIEW here should be different and I am not repeating anything said already.I placed ECO Dot permanently into an electrical socket by doing some neat homework, which you can see in the pictures.What I learnt, We need to ask diplomatically to the point first.For example, I asked Alexa, calorie value of a banana ? and Alexa could not answer. She answered beautifully when the same query put into a different way, nutrition value of a banana.Kindly include (from 1960s) old classical songs from Tamil and Hindi movies.Hope, Alexa learn more and more every day & soon create a very rich database and focused locally as well..TIPS:1. If you like to keep on wall power socket as I did, you must use only original 3M Double sided tape (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B013JM1SCY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). After pasting the tape and attaching both plug and the unit leave an hour for bonding before inserting into a wall socket tightly to avoid falling down. If you do not like, you can separate them neatly anytime in future by using a Dental floss/ fishing rod nylon thread.2. I have paired the ECO DOT with my AV Receiver (ONKYO HTS 3370) easily but you need little patience. Switch on ECO DOT and the Blue Tooth Device make them search and pair. Alexa will confirm and you need to say ‘Alexa connect to speaker’ in future. While configuring, never keep open other BT devices like your Laptop/ Mobile to avoid over lapping."
Sumit ,1,India,16-07-2020,FALSE,20,"Echo Dot never plays original songs, (No way to attach Audio Files)","The media could not be loaded. /*Here I'm Uploading video, enjoy*/Most idiotic device I every bought, never play original songs. Always play some or the other remix or instrumental songs.I wish I would have bought Google home or some Bluetooth speakers./*Some attachments after talking to Amazon Echo Dot Executive*/After my above review, Echo Dot representative called me, I'm glad for this.I showed him the issue with song selection but he told me that it is because of library doesn't have songs that I'm selecting and it is better to add gaana.com from alexa app, after following his guidelines, I repeated and recorded issues. Please see the screen shots and listed to audio for Alexa and have fun (Now I realise amazon review doen't support audio but only video).You can buy this device if you have to have personalised fun in your life. The is not way of attaching Audio files only video so this is again funny, if I wan't to attach some feedback for Alexa why do I need Video :).

Secret Senpai,1,India,20-05-2019,FALSE,25,A BIG NO,"I am writing about my genuine experience. I have Google home mini and I built an Attic so I thought why not buy another smart system like Amazon echo 3 but it was my mistake to buy it,like whenever I asked little complicated questions it says sorry I don't know it and whenever I say you're useless it also says sorry I don't know about that also, it sounds little better than Google home mini and also catches microphone sound little better but what's the point if it can answer what you ask for, if you want to listen songs you have to you have prime membership otherwise you can't listen songs so I did not have any prime membership and I have to pay 999 for that just listen songs, 8 out of 10 times it fails to answer your questions so it will get to your nearv pretty quickly,if you have low temper then you can buy it, my only advice is use your hard earned money properly and buy a Google home mini it will never disappoint you, like never"

Vijay Kumar,1,India,12-10-2019,FALSE,19,Amazon is selling an experimental product.,"Before buying this product please keep these points in mind:- You need amazon prime account for Rs. 999 per year to listen to music from amazon. Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn, Gaana, etc.- Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often.- If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair, the app cannot control the music. You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist. The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot.- You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App.- No real support exists for this device. If you call amazon support staff, they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features.- If you want to use it as kids toy, then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa.- Audio quality is very basic. Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better.- This is really a no no product for music lovers. You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music, though these may cost you beyond INR15k.- Alexa does not understands most of the commands. Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa.- Amazon is not a software and hardware company. Don't expect quality software and hardware from them. You are being used as testers for their experimental products."

Commands cannot be configured easily. No way to configure your playlist. A playlist that exists in Amazon or Saavn is pathetic. No proper way to configure or use wifi that is available in public or your vacation places. The continuous power supply is required.

Doesn't understand most of the commands and doesn't have a huge number of songs which are very common, this makes choices extremely limited! Pairing is a serious pain on most occasions and thus isn't much user friendly either. Came free as a result of card usage else would have been hurting like anything. I feel Google speakers would be much better considering it's search is based on what's there on the internet rather than a perticular site or app! Using an android I know what Google assistant is capable off as compared to baby dumb Alexa!"

Worked well for one month, now, sound quality is pathetic, lots of distortion, speaker is vibrating during playing of high notes. And about Bluetooth connection with other devices (smartphones) is just pathetic, no doubt it will connect fast but what's the use of you see lots of Audio lag while playing videos, also if you use it as a Bluetooth speaker then you're gone guys, low sound output and bass is not that much good.Note: before one month speaker quality is good and bass is punchy if you play online song by activating Alexa. But after a month with minimal usage, speaker sound is just pathetic, chik chik sound is coming while playing high notes.I am planning to ask Amazon for the replacement, let's see that experience and I'll update it if they replace this pathetic product."

Chetan Sharma,4,India,25-10-2018,FALSE,14,The BEST smart speaker in the world!,"First of all don't even compare it to google dot. That thing will take ages to catch up to the tailor-made experience of Amazon echo dot for India.Now being a smart speaker this thing is not like a regular bluetooth speaker which is used to play your music but it's an interactive device which works on your voice command(or the app). Playing music is just one of its features and it can do a lot of other things for you. Infact it's learning to do new skills everyday. You can control your electronics (lights, t.v., or any other device connected to smart plug) , set up cameras, play games, quizzes, order food, do calculations, listen to radio, ask the questions of general knowledge or any other random information that you want.The sound is more than perfect for a mid size room but you can always connect it to another speaker. I have connected mine to the UE Boom 2 and the resulting sound quality is just amazing.It obviously takes time and investment to reap all the benefits of this tiny device but for sure this little dot will change the way you live in an amazing way."
Ajit Kumar,4,India,14-07-2019,FALSE,8,Affordable Smart Speaker : Intelligent and Smart,"Amazon Echo Dot ticks all the boxes, except it's sound quality. It's extremely powerful, smart and agile. The effort by the engineer's at Amazon shows. They have done a painstaking job to perfect Alexa. Microphones are powerful (Alexa even acted upon a request to play party music from a TV commercial!!). The sound quality needs to be worked upon. It's just not there. Considering that most of my requests are to play music, it needs to be crystal clear. It's not that small speakers can't sound good. JBL, for instance, sounds great even in its basic version. I had to invest in an extra Bluetooth speaker to make up the deficiency on the sound quality front ( Ultimate Ears Wonderboom costing Rs 4 k). Incidentally, I had a tough time searching for a compatible Bluetooth speaker as Amazon has not released any list of Echo Dot compatible speakers. I had made a call to Echo support and even the support executive could not help me. Finally after two cancellations, I hit upon Wonderboom, which is terrific with the Echo Dot."

They are giving fake excuses for service they are temporary un available for service of alexa after few days the warranty get to expire then they say your product warranty has expired so we did not give you a service for your product. “ excuse me amazon all of the world wide companies change their policies in national lockdown.” I think amazon policy are worst.

So no more asking friends to get them from there!!!! Anyone sitting on the fence can buy this instead of buying bluetooth speakers. This is 5th Echo dot including earlier versions and Google Mini doesnt even come close when it comes to smartness. While Google mini answers google search questions better - no one is buying a smart speaker for that. Its integration with smart devices is unparalled and my mini appears dumb most of the times. Just grab this before it goes back to its old price. Even the smart bulb is very helpful. While watching TV..just ask Alexa to turn bulb blue or red!! Not sure if this bulb can dim...if so..you can use this both as a day bulb and a night bulb. Just go for it before its too late

Alexa got an attitude which is quite amazing.Siri, Cortana, and other voice assistants are no match for Alexa. Alexa acts better than Google in terms of finding information.It can almost answer to any anything whether your question related to history, IPL cricket scores or mythology. Alexa answers all of them with details.You can literally have a conversation with her and she is a great distraction when you're really tired of talking to real people.The money you spend on this device is definitely worth its value and time.the only negative I have is that you have to connect the dot to the power source.

Once the product is synchronised with the Alexa app on your mobile ,it retains its memory even if the power fails, though it has no battery back up. Alexa on the cloud retains it's memory. !!3.) Amazing sound quality for it's size. Good treble and bass.4.) The new rounded look with fabric finish is pleasing to the eye.5.) Can be used as an alarm clock and reminder for frequent travelers provided your hotel has free WiFi and good power back up.CONS :1.) No battery back up .2.)

Appart from that it will always say like ""sorry I don't know that one""😵. And each time you need to start conversations by saying Alexa, then only it will start recognise your commend. Within few minutes you will get a headache🤕.Music - When you say Alexa play music, their will play music from Hungama app. Very less collection is there. Especially Tamil songs are very very less. And mostly Alexa not playing the song which you ask. It will play on it's won. 🥴Finally - Good initiative from Amazon but needs of improvement.

One thing disappointed is that when say 'Alexa, play old telugu songs' in 2nd Gen Dot it Play old songs from retro station but in 3rd gen Dot it is playing telugu songs'(not telugu old songs).

Kamal,1,India,16-01-2020,FALSE,8,Waste of money,"- The Alexa app is useless when it comes to some configuration changes.- It does not change the WiFi connection. Tried with 2 different phones Android and IOS, but could not change the WiFi connection.- The choice of music service is very limited. Just Gaana, Saavn and Amazon Music is available. You cannot configure, change, remove or add other music services. And for some reason the device only uses Gaana and Saavn and never uses Amazon Music.- The Bluetooth is of Out mode. Means you can play music from Alexa on other devices. But you cannot play music from your phone via Bluetooth on Alexa.- Like the Bluetooth, the 3.5 mm audio jack is also of Out mode. Means you can play music from Alexa on other devices with AUX cable. But you cannot play music from your phone or small mp3 players via AUX cable on Alexa.- The Alexa voice command is definitely Not that effective or responsive as it is claimed or advertised.- It cannot help kids in pronunciation of words. If they spell the word to the device and ask for its pronunciation; the device is confused.- Sound quality is good. But not worth the money.- Ohh Great! now while I compiled my review, Amazon reduced the price by 500 to Rs. 2999 from earlier Rs. 3499. Now this is really Pathetic."

I was thinking to buy  bluetooth speaker for eco dot thinking that it may not have enough sound and quality. But thanks to Amazon, did superb Job.It has four mic and listen your commands very well from far away  and i can say it is picking command nicley from approx each corner of say 450-500 square feet room.It has max volume to 10 level and able to listen upto 6-7 level of music. In high volume, little difficult to listen your voice which is due to high volume of music. But if you are sitting close to Device, you can use button on device to give command.Nice and Compact Design as well.Tried doing few activity like plying music, adding task, adding reminders, weather forcast, news etc . All done nicley.Two great thing I like about is that device very well recognise the voice and you can do next song, fast forward, adding song to favorite list, like or dislike the songs, create play list. And second thing is like adding activities to task and adding reminders, actually in normal course, or doing some activity, you sometime remember something or want to add something to to-do list or say monthly shopping list, but what happened when you sit to prepare that list of stuff you need ot task to do, you forget that stuff or activity. With the help of this device, you can add that stuff immediately when it get  striked to you so that at last moment you need not spend time on remember that stuff.Lastly need to say, it can be a superb personal assistant.Ill rate 4.5 Stars, next update on eco dot , amazon can think of wireless Eco Dot, so we can carry here and there. Currently user need to place it always near power point, which may not be the desired location and second improvement i recommend is to have wall hanging/ wall mount option. Because I personally want to hang in middle between my bedroom and drawing room so that i can gibe command from either side. Third Improvement can be wireless charging. These three improvement make it must buy although still its a must buy.Superb Job Amazon."

Sneha Pathak,4,India,03-11-2018,FALSE,10,4 stars to Alexa,"Overall a good product with lots of skills that u can add. Easy to install and start and looks so perfect. It has a really good voice range in both senses- the speaker in its full is pretty powerful plus Alexa manages to hear you even from the next room. Not good with regional languages though. Still learning i guess. Plus sometimes shows some glitches in responding especially if you are requesting something like a hindi song and can sometimes not tell you the desired information. But that hapoens rarely. Overall, happy with the device after 10 days of usage."
Abhinav Jaiswal,5,India,31-10-2018,FALSE,13,Great Product....!!,I had been using the echo dot 2nd generation for some time now and was quite pleased with it. So when they launched the 3rd generation echo dot with better speakers and multiple mikes i wasn't hesitant. I was not surprised at all as it lived upto my expectations and to some extent exceeded them. The speakers are much louder and better as compared to the earlier generation and may be the listening capacity is also better. To top all this they have also made it much better looking with the fabric finish on the sides.

The 4 mics are very sensitive and is picking up the voice commands even from my 3 yr old daughter without any glitch and even from a far distance, my entire family is enjoying a lot. You just name it, and Alexa in echo dot is ready with the answers. The accuracy of the answers range between ~80 to 100%.2. The sound output is crystal clear with all the high notes, mid range and even the low notes (bass) equally balanced and is just awesome to listen to music.3. Connecting to WiFi network is as easy as a knife through a butter, but connecting to your own mobiles WiFi hotspot is really a bit cumbersome as another mobile with WiFi hotspot is needed only if you are unable to connect echo dot to any WiFi networks during first installation as echo dot gets an update (updates regarding the mobile hotspot) as soon as you connect to WiFi network for the first time.4. The Bluetooth can easily be setup by the ""Pair"" voice command.5. The output from the 3.5mm jack is also awesome when connected to an external speakers with amplifier.A must in every house.

There are other brand devices that are more intelligent and more useful. For a silly example, you can’t say “Alexa, switch on Bedroom light” at once. Instead, you have to first say “Alexa”, and wait until it responds, and then tell what you want Alexa to do as a separate command. Another example, if you have 2 lights named as “Hall light 1” and “Hall light 2”, and you ask Alexa to switch on “Hall light 1”, most probably Alexa will ask you back “There are multiple devices named Hall light. Which one do you want to switch on?”. That means while talking to Alexa, you’re not allowed to change your mood or tone until the command is complete. Theirs example, if you happen to start asking slowly to Alexa, “Alexa, I want to ask you about...”, immediate Alexa will reply you “Here is what I found on the web about ‘I want to ask you about’”, without even allowing you to complete your question."

Alexa dont have enough smartness to pick best answer out of all enabled skills.if you ask alexa for joke it will play same jokes in same sequence everytime, that's pathetic."
Kannan Kasturirangan,3,India,03-12-2019,FALSE,4,Just boring after couple of months,"Very nice product no doubt about it., All in family will be excited about it for a week or more but then the excitement will slowly wade away and coming to the real issue alexa is very poor in integration. Search is not very good and most of the music is from Amazon Music Library and if you do not have Prime membership there is no point in buying this as most of the music is from Amazon music library. I got along with the free wipro wifi led light. It always has doubt when asked to switch the lights on. Good thing is the sound quality is top notch for the device that is so small and alexa can hear your command even 50 mts away in a noisy environment. That is something to cheer about, otherwise it needs a lot of improvement in its search capability."
Prakash,5,India,19-11-2018,FALSE,9,Alexa - better than Siri or Cortana,"As an Alexa equipped Personal Assistant , Amazon Dot is incredible. I am using Siri in my iPhone and Cortana in my Windows Desktop. Compared with them, Alexa is far better. It gives crisp answers in multiple sentences and not one cryptic line. For example, ask her about the weather and she tells you about the weather in many sentences - temperature, humidity and the probability of rain. When asked the same question in Siri or Cortana - they say only the temperature - at least in my case.The Bluetooth Speaker barely consumes about 3 W and the consumption rises when used at high volumes. It is crystal clear. The only crib is its Bass response is a shade poorer. Not much of an issue as it uses a tiny speaker. So don't expect a rich full blooded sound from it.I am using this to control Sonoff Wifi Switches for my Home automation and it is wonderful to control all your devices with just your voice.At the end of the day, it is money well spent over a useful gadget."

It has volume up/down, set-up button with a nifty mute button. It has an ever convenient aux port for connecting to audio system which itself is a reason for my purchase. It can also connect with Bluetooth.Set-up was easy with the Alexa app and there a plethora of skills to try out.Sound was warm and the volume could be room filling. As expected there isn't enough bass but other than that the sound is good. Voice recognition is good and it may miss low voices. The Alexa voice is itself is like a person which is good and adds a personality to it. It can sometimes give very witty contextual answers. It's best used with Amazon products and generally good. Home automation is an area where it has an edge as most of the smart home products are Alexa compatible and generally speaking Alexa is best suited for Indian scene. I can stream high quality music from Amazon music being a prime member to my sound system and have added convenience of a smart speaker. You can find good deals and bundles at festivities if you are planning to purchase it."

Only my 5yrs old daughter was interested and wide eyed when Alexa spoke. lolI will start with Cons--You need to keep it plugged as it has no supportive battery.You need to keep repeating question like a parrot until Alexa understandsYou need to keep adding apps for alexa to function and that too does not work properlyAlexa does not recognise your playlist, Its not programmed that way, So even if your have list full of songs it will not play.Alexa only knows Savan and Amazon music which has very limited collection of songs.Now comes for the storytelling and other activities, It keeps repeating the same story and same jokes, same poems.

All ok now.Old Review:It took a lot if issues while setting up with app. Luckily am tech savvy so figured out.. also - It doesnt register any commands while giving an output. So if i ask it to play a song it will but when its playing a song i ask to stop or go to next it doesn't register the command and i have to manually hit the action button to give a command. Have ordered a replacement. Fingers crossed for the next piece
Indrani Das,5,India,01-08-2021,FALSE,2,Value for money smart speaker,"I was quite confused between echo dot 3rd & 4th Gen so bought both to try and after testing, I choose 3rd Gen bcoz of following reasons.1. Very responsive to voice command in comparison to 4th Gen.2. Only 1-1.5 scale down from 4th Gen in sound and bass quality.3. I prefer 3rd Gen hockey puck design than 4th Gen round shape (personal preference).4. For higher audio quality and output one can always use external speakers via aux cable.5. Can integrate with Google even via bluetooth.6. Easy to place anywhere without any scope of rolling off.7. LED ring light looks distinctive on top than bottom (4th Gen) bcoz one can't see its 360° view.8. Plays soft music prity well than hard.9. Can fit into confined space.10. Also paid only ₹1999.What more one can ask for."
Jack,5,India,10-08-2021,FALSE,3,Awesome,"The media could not be loaded.  Bought this and wipro 9w smart bulb in combo offer. Configured smart bulb in alexa. Cool thats it.Just say ""alexa, lights on"", ""alexa, turn light to red / blue"" etc.. you can alse even change the brightness ""alexa, change the brightness to 50%"" etc. You will get the manual within the wipro bulb box. There you can see the list of commands.Lets see the other options of echo dot. I connected this to home theater. It is just playing songs from any music station, my playlist. Tried these 2 options only. Mostly i play rhymes. Around INR 2500, i got this combo. Worth to play around."
Nitesh Mestry,1,India,13-01-2021,FALSE,2,Not worth buying,"I feel like I should have bought Google device in stead of this one. Alexa simply fails to recognize hindi and Marathi songs when asked to play. Now after one year plus later I realized that I use it only for switching the lights on and off. Other than that it as usual fails to recognize the commands. You cannot play songs from YouTube. Overall I feel like I shouldn't have bought this. I spoke with couple of my friends and they also faced similar challenges.Update on Feb 16th 2021 : After posting my review I got a call from Amazon and the executive asked to test the device while he was there on the call. As expected it failed to play the songs. Then executive told me that it seems you've got wrong device, it is meant to cater to US region and soon we'll replace your device with the one meant for India region. I was assured that they'll replace my device but no time-line given. I could see the order in my Amazon order list but today, after almost a month the order was cancelled! So it's a big no from my side if you are planning to buy alexa device!"
Mikunj Rathwa,5,India,08-08-2020,FALSE,3,Great purchase. Full value for money.,"I was pretty confused between google home mini and this one. So decided to give it a try first.I planned to return it back once I feel like I am not that impress. But guess what, once I had hands-on, I felt like I am never gonna find any con here. I just configured everything and started using it right there.Topmost and most imp - Music quality is highly impressive. I am already done with those excessive bassy audio equipment that I have in my home - Sony 5.1 Home theatre and a jbl charge 2+.Bass is cool but its not so cool when it comes to playing music all day long. And this echo dot fulfilled the purpose. Bass is pretty decent and mids and highs are quite crisp. It clearly sounds like some expensive device. Besides, it plays by itself. so your phone doesnt stay occupied.It is smart enough in thousands of skills that now I dont have a second thought of returning it.I purchased wipro bulb combo at 2300.One of the best feature here is broadcasting. I dont like making phone calls once I am outside. Alexa app allows me to type a broadcast message and send it to my home just with few clicks.Futuere is here guys. Give it a try. All good so far."
Ritwick Saikia,5,India,28-09-2021,FALSE,2,Hits far above its weight,"The speaker was larger than I thought it would be, a bit chunky but not too heavy. It doesn't move about, because it's nicely weighted, even if played at full volume though I believe 50-60% volume would be enough for most people. The sound is very good indeed. The Bollywood and dance songs play great and even the rock and metal songs are enjoyable. The bass is not very heavy but the sound seems weighted nice for bass heavy songs. Alexa makes it so easy to do so many things, especially if you have smart appliances and lights and all at home which are compatible. Sone things I find enjoyable are asking Alexa to turn on the tv via my smart plug and play a particular show on the fire tv stick and by the time I get to the living room everything's on and the show's about to start. You can even use it to call your family to dinner if you have two or more echo speakers. Some privacy issues are there but it's up to you how comfortable you are giving up some for the convenience it provides. Playing music, the news, weather updates, traffic updates, reading your Kindle library books to you, the possibilities are endless. Spotify too is very nicely integrated with Alexa. The only downside is that the Google feud means there's no YouTube or YouTube music support officially and you have to run through some hoops to get it working (P.S. look up Paul Hibbert on YouTube [oh the irony]). P.P.S.-Amit Bachchan's voice is now available via Amitji keyword but unfortunately you have to pay extra for it :)"
anil kumar,1,India,21-05-2019,FALSE,6,Not compatible with most wifi networks,"first of all the alexa app itself is around 79MB, the app response is dead slow. i got frustrated by the time it took to move from one screen to next screen. above all echo dot 3rd gene doesn't connect any of my wifi networks throwing the error"" registration failed try again later"" while my amzon fire stick works perfectly with all net works. i am very disappointed with the device , actually so excited to use this as i am a die hard fan of amazon but now i had return it."
Aswini Sahoo,3,India,20-03-2020,FALSE,4,Alexa is great but device needs to be improved,"I like Alexa and the features. But rated 3 due to the below facts.- No inbuilt battery. A big minus. In today's mobile world, you cannot enforce the device to be plugged in always.- No USB charging facility- Alexa app is horribly slow- The moment your wifi connection changes, it cannot detect. You need to reconfigure itPlus features- Device shape is great- Sound quality is superb- Voice response is awesome"
TechDevoteeIndia,2,India,04-01-2022,FALSE,1,Fantastic sound quality but alexa is useless,"In comparison with Google voice assistant devices -1. Eco dot 3 is awesome in hardware - mic recognises voice from far away distance and bass on speaker is super.2. But software experience is pathetic due to alexa which is not even 10% of google assistant. Very limited recognition of command and that too hit or miss by alexa.3. Alexa catches one command unlike combined commands in Google assistant.4. Unproductive things like telling jokes are only features of alexa. It can't even calculate dates.On/off smart plug & reminders are the only perfectly working things with Alexa !!!In layman terms - Google is hero and Alexa is joker.Limitations in speaker -Note that only 3.5mm output is possible, so eco dot 3 can't be used as 3.5mm speaker but can be used as Bluetooth speaker.You can't use mic in Bluetooth mode. So, not usable for calls.Alexa app -is inconsistent and not user-friendly. Critical features like alexa guard are not available in India.Voice recognition -It's always hit or miss with simple commands also.I bought to play online kannada music but voice recognition is limited to Bollywood movie names or artists for Indian music.It won't recognise 99% kannada music/movie/artist names.My VERDICT -Even though I got in DEC 2021 for 2299, I'm finding it useless. My usage is restricted to on/off smart plug at water heater and reminders, as reminders with 5 out 5 times whereas it's 4/5 with Google.Alexa ignored Kannada and all other South Indian languages, so time for us to ignore alexa and go with Google devices if South Indian languages are your need.Don't waste your money on alexa voice assistant devices."
anil,2,India,20-10-2018,FALSE,9,Not a great quality speaker and can't be used in a car,"I thought this could be used in our car as well.. but few feature does not allow it to be used so.. 1). It uses 15 volt power.. while car battery provides 12 volt power.. don't know if the car battery can support the power requirement.. 2). Probably, the power lead that comes with this product is not USB type universal charger that I was expecting from it. 3). I don't think the speaker is that great.. the sound emanating from is high on bass, I would have preferred Amazon allowing us to mix the quality preferred by me.. they should have added this feature in Alexa, since it boasts to have the world at your feet.Amazon probably would add these feature in their next generation.. but I feel cheated as I preferred to have it in the product that I brought.. not that the technology does not exists.. the sad part is that it does.. but corporation like Amazon will like milk their customer dry"
Amazon Customer,1,India,22-11-2019,FALSE,5,Limited capablity with very poorly designed sensors,"worst product amazon released into market in a hurry. Here are some, if not all, of the issues:1 - No sound clarity. Even from 4 feet one cant understand what alexa saying. muffled voice2 - Limited capability. Other than weather it doesn't know any significant much. I didnt buy it for weather or switch on a bulb.3 - Dont understand english language properly.4 -Its useless overall for anything and for anyone, be it kids or adults.Amazon has a long way to go before it can make it usefull."
Rahul Dubey,3,India,19-10-2020,FALSE,3,Good Hardware with just okayish software,"This review is for the Echo dot (3rd gen).On the Hardware front, the device is quite good(maybe best in the market) at this price, only one thing I would want it to have is a battery inside as you have to connect it to a power source always, which makes it less portable and for scenarios when there is an electricity cut (well we live in India-a developing country, here many areas even in the top cities don't have 24 hrs of electricity, Amazon would have considered this)The software front is just average.If you have used google assistant(Ok Google) on mobile/any device then you can think as Alexa answers just around 50% efficiently compared to google assistant (according to me). Alexa doesn't understand follow-ups like google assistant, every time you have to say ""Alexa"" first for everything, and it also doesn't understand many basic questions (like what are the flights from Jaipur to Delhi?, who played most IPL matches?-->it just says I don't know the answer), you have to be more specific in framing your query for Alexa, it is also not as good as google assistant with the Hindi language. Google Assistant is much more friendly than Alexa, with all that said I would say Alexa is about Half as smart as Google assistant.Only one thing good on the software front is it has the biggest Skills' library so you can automate/routine many things.On the last note, I would say this device is good to control smart devices in your home(like smart bulbs, plugs, appliances, etc), doing routine stuff like reordering regular things on Amazon(like grocery, etc), reorder foods, book cabs, etc. and obviously to listen to music online.I never own any google smart speaker, but with my research, I think Echo dot(3rd gen) is better on the hardware front and google nest mini(2nd gen) is better on the software front, well, it depends on you which to choose."
Ujjval Gadkari,5,India,18-06-2019,FALSE,3,Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa (White) : Echo Dot is awesome,"Well I bought Alexa on 19th May and writing this review on 19 th June.. so far my experience with Alexa is as below .All-new Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa (White) : Echo Dot is awesome, it is batter then Google Home in terms of connecting your Smart TV. It is even batter in understanding your requirement. Pros and Cons as per my 30 days usage along with Google Home is as below.Pros.1) Looks very decent2) Buttons are on TOP so you will not press any button mistakenly while moving your eco dot.3) Lights are on side and in all direction, so it is easy to view that Eco dot is taking your command.4) As per my observation, Speaker and Mike are not the same, as It takes your command from quite a distance even though speaker volume is set to 3 or 4.5) You can give command from almost 10 feet with your normal voice, you need not to shout or need not to raise your voice to give command6) Connect Smart TV very easily ( I have connected my SONY Bravia 55'' X8200 E Smart TV )7) You can change volume and change Channels by simply saying channel number or name "" Alexa change channel to Star Movies HD "" or "" Alexa Next channel"" or Alexa change channel to 251"" and ""Alexa increase / Decrease volume to 50% on my TV"" ""Alexa Switch on my TV"", "" Alexa Switch off my TV""8) Sound quality is very good.9) You can connect external home theater speakers with it with help of RCA adapter cable.10) Can pronounce your name in Indian Accent11) It has a very good collection of songs, so you can enjoy the songs as per your mood and day night situations.12) It was not understanding hindi before but now Alexa can understand little hindi too.13) Last but not least, It gives detailed answer for your questions or queries or it can tell even your horoscope or your favorite recipe, It can play radio FM, distance, book cab, book Food, add things to your Amazon cart and many more.. and More...Cons.1) It has a room of improvement2) Still baby and learning many things, so don't expect answer for all your questions3) Still can do very limited after connected to Smart TV, it can not open Applications like you tube or Sony liv, Hotstar, Zee5. So you have to depend on your TV remote for this.4) The biggest limitation is, It has to be connected to power plug and socket, you can not take it in your CAR ( You can take Google home in your car or you can connect Google home anywhere as Google home has power connector same as Mobile phones)5) It can not understand many Indian words, like I tried "" Alexa Riston me darar aai by Jagjit singh ) it never understood it while Google home can even understand one word like "" Hey Google riston me darar aai""6) You still can not call on mobile, can't send SMS."
Raj Narayanan,5,India,04-04-2019,FALSE,7,Im satisfied and happy with my dot.,"I will first give the steps to connect succesfully; for a brief general performance review, you may scroll down please.To successfully pair your phone, wifi and echo:1. Plug your echo on and download alexa on your phone.2. From the alexa app, pair your phone with your echo device first to establish the first connection between your phone and your echo.3. We need to set up wifi access on echo so that alexa on echo can be alive. To do that, after you've paired your echo with your phone, proceed to where you can search for the available wifi networks. Connect to your wifi network on alexa app by entering your wifi password. Post this, your echo should be connected to wifi and alexa on your echo should be online.4. You can pair alexa with any bluetooth speakers if you have any. You may also pair your phone with your echo with bluetooth so that you may play your local AV via your echo. Yes you can play music from phone. To connect to bluetooth, enable pairing on your echo. To do that, command, 'Alexa pair' and you should hear alexa respond. When she does that, she is ready to pair; open your phone's bluetooth settings and connect to your echo. The connection should now be successful.5. Develop skills for alexa and keep interracting with her so that your relationship blooms. Any relationships are funny to understand at the beggining. Believe me, there is a deep meaning and truth in my previous sentence.As for the performance part, there's no compromise from my point of view and your echo dot can easily compete with most advanced dedicated speakers of its size.The bass is pretty decent. The treble is at a good feel as well. At full volume, there is no screeching or dampening. The sound is premium than previous echo dot.Echo plus will obviosuly nail it, way better than dot, so please do not compare plus with dot. Both peform exceptionally based on budget.You cannot wire in audio to your echo dot (nevertheless, you can bluetooth in your audio), but you can wire out to external speakers. When wiring to your external speakers maintain 15cms for optimal performance.I hope this helps. Peace'o & cheerios folks :)"
nalin c.,5,India,27-07-2021,FALSE,3,Discounted price with Add-on Item lower than the purchase price of item 18 days back,"This is unfair. You make people buy at higher prices and then bring in a special price for two days wherein you discount it heavily with an add on product for free. I paid 2800 Approx for just the Echo Dot, after waiting for a discounted price like the one in January wherein I received Echodot with Oakter. Now ofcourse at 2299/- you are offering echodot with light bulb, which beats both the purchases made by me.I think I deserve a wipro bulb for being a faithful customer.."
Amazon Customer,2,India,06-05-2019,FALSE,4,Not of much use - Amazon should pay the users rather than charging from them.,"The feature of Alexa Calling works only with contacts who have the echo devices. In short, you cannot use to call the mobile or phone of your contact list if the other person doesn't own another echo device. This is too absurd and a feature which should be clarified to customers in marketing communication.The voice recognition and song lists is another area which needs a lot of improvement. Until and unless the song is shared exactly as it is listed with starting words, Alexa doesn't identify it. Also, it does not play My lists in Amazon music. It is a challenge to keep repeating the command with numerous voice modulations and starting point so that Alexa plays the right song. It is a real pain.In short, in my opinion, Amazon should pay the early users for giving it a learning experience rather than charge money for such half baked product. Amazon is actually using the early users to improve Voice recognition technology and reporting the glitches of the product..."
Prasadji2015,5,India,17-10-2018,FALSE,6,Very impressive,"Pre ordered the item and was delivered by Sunday. If the packing was impressive by Amazon, the setting up Alexa was even more. Very easy to set up and without any hassle-be it WiFi, Bluetooth speakers or operate smart gadgets.Understands Indian English without any problem and answers anything from science mathematics politics countries etc referring Wikipedia. Plays so many songs from Amazon Music as well as from Saavan. I was stunned to hear soundtrack version of old ones like Sound of Music , Abba to latest Lady Gaga. About Hindi....wow any song from Md Rafi, Kishore to latest. Plays any online FM radio in Tune in in all Indian languages and English. Right now it can translate English to Hindi or any international language. May be more Indian languages added soon.I was shocked with joy when Alexa was able to tell the Malayalam movie running in Chennai with PVR multiplex name when asked to name the Malayalm movie running in Chennai.I tried different Bluetooth speakers like Bose Boat or Philips and pairs like a charm.Create your play list in Amazon Music or Saavan and play. Regarding the placement of Echo, try keeping a little above from the floor . It will enhance the bass several times and also fill the room to sound great. Please see my photo for that. All new Echo 3 Gen is a must for anyone who like music and fun with internet gadgets.It does not get hot or the power adopter ."
Pankaj Bharti,4,India,21-07-2020,FALSE,7,Made In China,"Overall product is very good. I really loved it.But, I returned this product because it's ""Made in China"".I proud to be Indian and I respect my country and our soldiers.If Amazon can give me choice to buy same product made in different country, then I will surely buy it again."
Shiva Kakkar,4,India,19-06-2019,FALSE,4,Good for cheap home automation,"I read a number of reviews where people trying to connect it to their phone hotspot are not able to. The solution is to in reading the instructions carefully. If you want to connect to a hotspot don't select the phones WiFi network during setup on alexa app. There is a separate option at the bottom (where the wifi networks are listed) to connect to the phone hotspot. Next, in the hotspot settings of your phone check that you have allowed unknown devices to connect. For example, in Samsung phones by default it allows only known devices to be connect to the the hotspot. Turn off the setting and Echo will connect to the phones hotspot. I have two wifi networks configured for my echo. If my first network goes down, Echo switches to my phone hotspot easily. Just read the setup instructions carefully.I bought it for automation and multiroom music streaming. It fulfills the purpose to a large extent. However, I feel that Amazon should have given more granular control of volume. The 10 level volume doesn't give you much control and sometimes going from (say) level 7 to level 8 is too much of a jump. Secondly, the volume of alexa and the connected speaker doesn't sync. Each has to be adjusted independently. In Samsung phones you have the option to bind the phone volume and speaker volume. This sort of function should be there. Apart from this, the third party development and support for the connectedness devices is excellent and I feel it'll trump Google home in some time. That ways I can see it as a much more future proof bet."
Karan,2,India,28-06-2021,FALSE,1,Buy the 4th generation,"Like:1. The product is good for listening to random music playing in you room2. It is shape, size and look are appealingDislike:1. Sound quality is poor, more often than not you find the sound quality muffled.2. Volume sometimes feels weak, it should have been a bit higher3. It can used as a Bluetooth speaker for random song playing from your phone but you can’t use it to listen to audio content like watching an audio clip / series / Netflix etc. in such a scenario the audio is muffled and difficult to comprehend.4. It’s plays music from Amazon music which lacks variety in its music. We’ll also know it’s nothing like YouTube library5. Finally, when Alexa doesn’t even understand or comprehend your request, it gets annoying to the next level.6. Volume is audible in limited space… you’re room for example.Conclusion: it’s a device good for listening to random music in your room playing constantly in the background while you’re at your chores.I got it coz I didn’t have a secondary phone to play music on my Bluetooth speaker."
Aman,2,India,22-10-2020,FALSE,2,Very Disappointed with it's Voice Recognition,"I seriously hate saying ""Alexa"" now. Voice recognition is the worst thing I have experienced in this device. I just use this in a small 10x10 room and most of the time I have to repeatedly repeat and repeat or even yell ""Alexa"" to wale the device.I never expected to get such experience from this device after going through ratings and reviews of the device. I was confused between Google Nest Mini and Alexa Echo Dot 3rd Generation and only choose this because of AUX output which was really useful feature but just after few hours since I am using this, I am really frustrated with it. I have tried resetting the device and voice training it but nothing helped. It is placed just 2 feet away on bedside table and no noise but it still won't get the word ""Alexa"" or understand most of the time. I have to always repeat myself and speak louder. Far field microphone feature on the device description says it can hear you from across the room. Seriously!!? It cannot even catch the ""Alexa"" word from 2-3 feet away and if its playing music even on low volume then it won't work at all and I have to yell ""Alexa"" many times from a feet or even closed to make it stop.Even it's Alexa assistance doesn't get me most of the time and just goes dormant without any response.Very disappointed with it. Going to return it now."
Sandip Kumar De,5,India,16-10-2018,FALSE,7,Toy for the big boy,What an amazing product? A must have for all home. Spend some more money in the smart home accessories and you can use its full power.

RAVINDRA GOPAL,3,India,19-10-2021,FALSE,1,Average performance,"I am returning after trying various commands for about a week. This is a recent review.Received only 2 days ago. So initial impressions.Not checked integration. Oakremote that I purchased with Echo was a flop.+ves -Voice recognition , Quick response, Family is having fun giving commands-ves: It generally plays music from Amazon music library. THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD. Sounds like 19th century radio. It works only when Wifi and Electricity are available.I am keeping it for the novelty and as a sample of future AI. Would be happy if it lasted atleast till 2022 Diwali😜"
Kapil Soni,4,India,26-12-2020,FALSE,1,Could have been better,"We purchased Gen3. The voice of assistance is too heavy. No equalizer settings. App has a very poor design and functionality. Sound of music is rich, but very poor in high frequency (treble), bass is good as per the size of speaker. Overall, good to hear music. AI is just okay, has very limited AI features, Mobile's Google voice is way more intelligent in answering questions. Good for wakeup alarms and listening music. Apps like spotify is very poor as opposed to Advertisement shown. Youtube selects better song lists rather than Amazon's music or Spotify. Gaana is still better, but way behind Youtube. Crux: If you have a small and good quality speaker system, just pair with your mobile and it shall be better; more better if use an old phone as no sms & phones shall disturb. These smart speakers are always listening (except for mute) ... always leaves me in doubt."
Chakraborty,5,India,06-07-2020,FALSE,2,Total value for money...,"In a word... Just fabulous...Not that much works in queries like Google. But GK level is quite good.For music it's outstanding.Voice recognition, sound quality, the LED ring ... All experiences are just awesome.Don't know about Home assistance, didn't try but didn't work to call or message on any number. Whom you are calling need to be added with your Alexa Profile. Of course you won't give access to outsiders. It's only use for family members only. So it's not useful that much.But After all these ifs & buts... Me & my family members like it very much.."
SnoopyDa,2,India,19-08-2019,FALSE,3,Inferior to the 2nd Gen and Echo Dot,"The speaker can't be used as a wireless Bluetooth speaker.It's AUX interface is an audio in only. So unlike the 2nd gen echo or the echo dot, you can neither transfer the audio to a secondary better speaker nor to any headphone or earphone.It does not have a battery so it always needs to be powered.The above are serious shortcomings not anticipated from a newer generation device.Apart from that, the Alexa integration works pretty well and as expected. However Alexa seems far inferior to Apple Siri when it comes to maintaining the context of a conversation.Overall a nice buy if you wish to experience a voice enabled product that can get a lot of things done. But perhaps not worth the price given the above observed shortcomings.If any of my observations are inaccurate, please do leave a comment. The views are personal and with no intent to promote or prevent any buying decisions."
Jithender Vanga,3,India,22-10-2018,FALSE,7,Very informative. works great ...,"Great Device, I'm still learning what Dot can do. Easy and fun to use, it Tells you everything, bad part it will not play recent news, or live news, more issues while connecting the device from Bluetooth, sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini..some times it says 'can't find it on the web'!!! I think there is a lot of improvement needed ..Need prime membership to play good songs, all songs are not available.... unable to play YouTube...best part of Alexa is that she can set multiple alarms and reminders. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc. Hope Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills..."
Arun Suresh,4,India,07-05-2019,FALSE,3,Nice compact intelligent ai assistant with a Bluetooth speaker.,"Overall good product. With double offer it was reasonably priced. Good voice recognition. The sound and it's quality could have been slightly better. However I feel only people with Amazon prime will benefit from the Amazon music. Otherwise I'm not aware of any other way of listening to music as of now. Pandora is not available in India. It may play from web? Not sure of that.There is an option on asking for a radio station where it tunes and plays songs from it. Did not try and the video was American. Voice recognition is spot on. With Amazon prime there is option to shop online through alexa, good list of songs such that u can say a song name or artist and Alexa will play. Intelligent enough ai that I felt like iron Man talking to Jarvis."
Anirban Das,5,India,12-11-2019,FALSE,2,Superb Buy,"One of my best purchases so far from Amazon . I purchased this product after going through a lot of reviews and researches . At one point is was almost convinced to buy the Google Home mini ,but eventual decided to buy the Amazon Echo dot 3rd Gen , after finding out that it has modified itself to understand Indian ascent. So here are the pros and cons after 1 month of usagePROS-Smooth InstallationGet the Alexa app at your cell phone and installation is smooth and easyConnecting to the wifi is ok - at first it took a while , but then it was smoothConnecting to a blue tooth device is really fastLovely sound quality and is decent enough for a big sized room.Can play almost any song (i tried , hindi , eng and of course being a Bong i tried all sorts of Bengali songs)Yes it plays maximum songs from Amazon Music , and then goes to Sawan or other music libraries too.Language can be set as English and HindiOne can set reminders , play quiz, it can make animal sounds , ask about weather conditions and forecast , in fact it can answer most of your queries .(its a best fried of my 1 year old son)If you have a smart light , you can even set to turn on/off the light (in my case i got the Wipro smart led bundled as free)CONSHave to admit that the search option has to be updated a little , in case of little difficult things it cant search its library and ansCant play songs from YouTube (obviously copyright issue )Its always plug and play , it doesn't have a battery . Makes it a little difficult to carry , cos it requires electric plug-ins (unlike portable Bluetooth speakers )over all its a great buy , barring few negative things which obviously can be ignoredand what makes it more amazing is that i got it at 40% discount during the GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL"

Very high data usage - I have been using Echo Dot through my mobile hotspot, it was working fine until a month back since when it has started to consume huge amount of data over hotspot. Today it consumed around 800 MB while I connected it to my hotspot for around 20 mts and played on songs in that time.I have been facing this issue everyday for almost a month now. All of my data is getting exhausted in trying to operate Echo Dot!2. Unable to process requests - Since last month it has not been taking commands well, and no matter how clearly you command it plays something else most of the times.I do not know how to contact product service team/Amazon representatives hence mentioning the issue faced here. Hoping to hear back from concerned representatives.Regards,Vikram"
S. Ramchandani,1,India,29-06-2019,FALSE,4,Alexa needs to be fired,"I agree with some reviewers that the software on this ECHO DOT (3rd Generation) is terrible & frustrating. Most instructions are not understood or wrong actions are taken. Most probably factory seconds or rejects of this echo were dumped in India. While the speakers sound good, the speakers on my phone sound better (without the headphones).Besides I feel most of these voice regognition devices make you a lazy person & a couch potato..so get up exercise switch on & off the lights yourself, walk move & do your own errands..Meanwhile wait for a better Amazon device."

Alexa reminds everything everyday every minute. Sometimes we mostly forget our scheduled tasks. Like pills, matches, shopping, things to remind. Alexa is everywhere where has internet.i m really amazed was going to buy Google mini but compare to this luxurious Google mini no match for look or sound. And Alexa is getting better everyday but not match for Google. Who wanna reminders alerts, songs, sound quality and looks go for this. Google take voice commands better. But Alexa also does everything I need 100%."

The sound quality is really nice and tried automating various household appliances with the help of Broadlink Pro and works very will like TV, AC, Music System etc.Cons:If you are playing a song on full volume then Alexa doesn't respond and you need to use the mobile app to stop the music or need to use manual command button available on echo dot."
Nishant,3,India,09-01-2019,FALSE,5,A mediocre overpriced product.,"I have been using the Alexa for about a month now.

You can hear the songs from anywhere around your home.-Good for engineering purpose. You may hack it for your own bespoke purpose, for IOT applications.-Amazing new tech.Why I don't recommend buying Alexa?-It works wobbly when it comes to giving voice commands in between an ongoing music or action.-Does not work with Google Maps.-Serch engine is poor and limited too.-More expensive than it's counterpart, Google Home Mini."

Spoke with Amazon Tech support, they went ahead with raising replacement after some troubleshooting. Now, they picked the device. Though no replacement update. Nothing in the app which indicates that the product has been picked up or replacement has been sent.Moreover the device itself dont have connectivity with ZOOM app and for calling in India.

Saahil Singh Bains,1,India,02-11-2020,FALSE,1,Worst Integration ever.,"This device refused to set up because the Alexa app just didn't work on my mother's phone. I had bought this for her. I even tried signing out of the Alexa app on my phone and then tried logging into her account on my phone and as soon as I would log in, the app would go blank.I'm still confident that there is nothing wrong with the Echo device but there is a problem in the Alexa app. More specifically there is a problem with my mother's account on the Alexa app. Unfortunately there is no way to fix this or talk to any kind of customer support. Customer support is a chat bot which has a preset list of questions that you need to select. There is no way to get any support for the app.My suggestion would be to stay away from such 'dumb' smart speakers. Amazon US is very helpful, because the laws in that country require them to be. Amazon in India sucks when it comes to Alexa app support, because there is no way to talk/ chat to someone who can check the account.Its strange that my worst purchase from Amazon is actually an Amazon product and not something sold by a listed seller."

Mambo,5,India,05-09-2020,FALSE,1,Good Sound Quality.,"Sound Quality was unexpected from such a small device with a single small speaker. I enjoy FM radio (through skill) everyday. This is very useful as analog FM reception in our area is very bad. Through skills it reminds me of my medication. Command detection is mostly accurate. But when searching for music, it plays wrong songs at times may be because of the very limited music collection with amazon. Pairing with a second Bluetooth speaker using ""discover"" command is not working unless you remove the already paired device using Alexa app. I wish the alarms and reminders had user programmable/uploadable bells/voices as there is only one sound in the alarm settings."
Some Nath Roy,4,India,18-11-2021,FALSE,0,Best as first voice assistance speaker. VFM,"I have been using echo dot since it was first launched in India and was available via invite basis. This one I bought to gift. This 3rd gen one has improved on sound. Although the voice recognition I feel was better in 2nd gen. Alexa has matured really well in these many years. The peripheral accessories have improved and most importantly have become cheaper.There should be a version with battery back up, it is a long pending improvement. Amazon should look into this now.Also integration with google (it may never happen, but fingers crossed!) Could be the ultimate goal for Alexa. It will help in direct calling from android, and information system will improve leaps and bounds.Device works perfectly fine, although I was pissed of when I saw that they are using pin charger instead of micro usb now. Which means you need to carry that extra charger wherever you go.Fabric sides feel nice in hands. Microphones works ok. Integration between your firestick and Alexa has become better.I also bought one 4th generation echo dot for myself, and that doesn't sound that much better. Please stick to the 3rd gen if you want VFM echo dot.Finally, it is something you do not need, but it feels nice when it is around. Children loves it. I have almost everything integrated with alexa, lights, fans, vaccum cleaner, Ac.... It can shop for you, it can book cab for you, it can do so many things, but finally you will only use it to listen to songs, please mark my words.So if you want to indulge with technology, if you want to get into an integrated environment, this is for you, you may get better speaker than this in this price range, but it is not just a dumb speaker. It is an experience which you may enjoy if you have that technology 'keeda' in you."
anirban,2,India,22-08-2021,FALSE,0,poor design thinking and lack of  access restrictions ruins good recognition,"I bought this as a productivity tool- during the pandemic while I drift between office work and housework, I need something to remind me of upcoming tasks or meetings. It fails terribly due to lack of thinking by the designers.1. This devise should require a password or PIN or recognize the voice of the person before proceeding further. It should not allow anyone to hijack your device- in my case my 7 year old, who keeps fiddling with the reminders or moving it away from a central location to his room. ( don't tell me you can't do voice classification, then at least ask a PIN ). For me the device is useless now, as I may not even hear it and important reminders may get removed. 2. The India model at least has no working profanity filter, my son plans music with profanity and there is no way to restrict access.3. Searches sometimes fail miserably- it is not recognition, the problem is the content that is being searched for an answer. Google's device is probably is stronger here with search results4. The reminders should have an option to repeat till I turn it off by saying ""acknowledged' or 'done'"
Manish Sharma,1,India,30-12-2019,FALSE,2,Gyd audio but really bad and dumb Alexa assistant..Horrible answers..Very Dissatisfied.,"Alexa is horribly wrong and Dumb..I made a mistake by not buying google mini speaker..Alexa has no answers...It is a stupid speaker..I know u need to enable the skills and all that..However, it is still a very bad Assistant..Fully disssatisfied..Audio quality is good but one can buy a simple bluetooth speaker at 1/3rd the cost rather than messing ur mind up with such an incapable AI speaker.. It cannot answer 90% of your questions.Used with Fireststick: limited usage and that too with limited apps.Will still need the remote anyway. Not much useful with Firestick.I strongly suggest please Buy google home mini instead..Audio may be a bit less but the google assistant is amazing.."
Ramana Murthy Devulapalli,2,India,08-01-2022,FALSE,0,Keeps shouting the device name it is playing from,"Everytime I connect to the device it says playing from and mentions my device name. This comes at high volume as this volume can only be controlled through the device. But this doesn't end here. Alexa shouts playing from and my device name everytime. If I lock my system and re-login then it shouts this message. If I stay idle and don't move my mouse for 5 mins and then move it then I get this mesaage again. Sometimes it happens when I am playing videos as well. A video will be playing and suddenly Alexa shouts playing from and my device name. Unfortunately even though I tried many things to get rid of that, I wasn't able to get rid of this sound till now. When I connect to Alexa speaker for the first time it doesn't connect properly and it plays with breaking sounds. This happens many times and I have to keep disconnecting and connecting it back till it works properly. Overall it is a fine speaker but there are too many problems that I face everyday with it."
Naveen,2,India,19-10-2018,FALSE,6,Great disappointment,Usually we see upgrade with next gen products but this seems to be downgrade for eco doc. I have used previous version which was much better than this one in terms of command recognition and accuracy of response. New eco dot is too far from accuracy and may lead to frustration while interacting with the device.It cannot recognise the books available on kindle library which is a very basic skill. It cannot recognise songs we request. Cannot play popular songs as well. Not sure what kind of advanced tasks it can perform when fail to do very basic tasks. Great disappointment.
J pathak,1,India,13-08-2020,FALSE,2,Pathetic,"A great device to get started, echo dot is a great device to first know your requirement. Alexa is integrated well enough but the voice recognition will give you trouble in later stages as it fails to recognise simple regular commands after a while, you will only see the blue light which after taking no action will turn off and resume the ongoing task. Many times it will disappoint and embarrass you, can only hope it to get better in future.Update:After using it for 1 year i would say it isn't that good of a device, now out of 10 times calling itout, it wouldd hardly respond twice. May be they have made the 4th gen better in this aspect but this device if you're even getting at a discounted price of 1k, don't bother. Not worth your money."
KARTHIK S,5,India,27-06-2021,FALSE,1,My first smart speaker,1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.
Tamil TechGuruji,5,India,16-10-2018,FALSE,10,Reasonable price,Very good product at reasonable price1. Mic sensing very good2. Third Gen Echo Dot very good in sound quality3. Nice and Compact Designwhen comparing to google home mini its pretty good quality wise
R44,4,India,28-04-2021,FALSE,1,"Decent product, but has many software bugs... Hope they are fixed in the future.","Hello,I purchased this from somewhere else.. After using it for a while, i noticed the amazon music service doesn't work at all. I was under the impression that amazon music, which is freely available with echo devices would work. After trying for hours to make it work i gave up, Alexa replied that ""She couldn't find anything"" whenever i tried to play something on amazon music. The only service that works good so far is Hungama Music. I am saying this after testing all the other services like Gaana, JioSaavn, Spotify etc... Gaana works as well but it has some issues... Spotify also works but lacks many songs.Aside from that, the mics are good but only till the volume medium, because high volume makes the device hard to hear us. Anything over volume level 6 is bad, and Alexa won't hear us unless we shout at her. I really liked the 2nd gen which had 7 mics yet this one only offers 4.. which is a downside for me. Hardware wise the sound quality is good until the volume level 8, but anything over that makes the sound distort and would be a pain to hear it.Alexa is on the other hand is good to talk to, she (It) can play music, tell jokes, read stories, sing songs, set alarms, set reminders, control smart devices etc... with the bonus of human like speech. This was the factor made me buy this. But on the downside she lacks too much intelligence compared to her counter part Google assistant.. She can't even answer the basic questions and just forwards us to Wikipedia. I hope amazon continues to improve Alexa.So as a new buyer which one to buy? Alexa or GoogleIf you don't care about how the assistant speaks, (robotic speech vs human like speech) then go for Google assistant speaker. Because Google and Alexa devices can both can do the job for smart homes. But Google uses their vast database infrastructure for information so obviously it will have upper hand in this department.But if you care about how your speaker speaks then go for Alexa.. without thinking anything.If you care about information then go for Google assistant else Alexa should be your preference."
Ranjith K.,3,India,01-11-2018,FALSE,2,Skeptical Product,"Hi Future buyer,Planning to buy this device wud be highly not recommended if u r a noob to this and in case u r running a custom rom on your andriod device.The App is confusing as much as it can be and force closes if u r not on factory OS, neither will there be any help or nor any reply to your mails from the developer, The setup dint go well and took me to register the product from web based registration.Otherwise the Product build quality is excellent when compared to the previous one and sound quality is amazing in the new one, Non the less Google home mini still has a better speaker but its hard to differentiate having both at my house side by side,You r also not to be surprised if u find your router to behave funny when both Alexa and Google home mini are side by side, Its like they r fighting for Bandwidth.The results are quite slow and takes time for reply when compared to G Home mini.The LED looks damn good at night and kinda adds upto the entire beauty of the productOverall if u r someone with good skill set on these things and just want to showoff ur house go for it I wud recommend to buy, others if u r a nood ( Fresher ) go for google home your life will be easy"

I am frustrated.2) Always need connectivity with internet / Bluetooth to operate any device.3) not playing music easily wherever we want.4) don't waste money if don't have 24 hours internet connection and related smart device.5) from desktop PC it is not connecting from cable and even from Bluetooth adaptor.So please please don't waste your money on it.Not a smart device it is useless device.
k2max6,2,India,26-08-2020,FALSE,0,Too much hype,"This review is especially for those sitting on the fence .I’ve been using Google Nest and minis and wanted to shift to Echo for its Drop in feature basically .(the full intercom) . It worked fine. But overall Alexa was disappointing. Even after having 4 mics the voice recognition was only a tad better than Google. The sound is natural but artificially natural, a little muffled as well.The app is poor. What takes less than a minute to setup on Google Home it takes over 3-4 minutes on alexa app. I have over 40 smart devices in my home and the time it needed merely setting up those devices was a bummer. Echo or Alexa is is just popular because Amazon sells it while Google devices are not marketed that much."

Bit to be honest, its not that good in hearing your voice as 2nd gen do. I am having trouble making it listening.- led circle light is little dull. I dont like it.- no great in sound except a 10% increase in bas. Say prev. Gen was having zero bass n its having little bass.- more asthetic look. I liked it.- power cable is not usb micro so u cant connect to other power sources. Its having adapter. So u re more on home stuck like to power socket. I am usong 2nd gen in car as well with usb cable.- bulkier, maybe good for sound n more of in stuff but earlier was more smaller n compact having ligher weight.CONCLUSIVE: Its addition of money and new device.

Good sound quality on playback.Cons so far:1. Sound is muffled for the responses from Alexa, you can't make out clearly on what it says most of the time. No fix yet { reduced one star because of this. }. Due to this issues it's being used as just a music player most of the time.2. Compared to Google Mini, Alexa's search contextual hits are lower.3.

Works great with automation and wifi devices (switches , light etc).2.pretty loud for the sound .3.mic's are great can pic the sound really well.4.robust design .5.can perform tasks related to amazon and some other apps like zomato , ola , ndtv , aajtak , saavan and a few more .Cons:1. Cannot play music from spotify , although Spotify is now in india the echo dot doesn't support it in India it ll say that Spotify is not available in your region.2.cannot do Google related tasks , for example if I ask it for the ""price of Hayabusa"" it search's for Hayabusa on amazon and tell me the price of random toys , has issue with SEARCHING for stuff.3. Lacks a lot of voice features and has some glithes like when u tell it to start stopwatch it asks me for alarm .4. Heats up a bit on the top .5.wifi coverage isn't the best .Well If you are looking for good sound and not so many voice features then echo dot is for you , but if u want to person searches and play music on Spotify then I feel google home is a better option.Alexa can get better in the future but for now it lacks quite a lot of features"
Amit,5,India,03-10-2019,FALSE,4,Integration with Gaana Saavn Hungama,"Writing this review after 2 days. It's a nice product overall. I purchased this product primarily for music. And was quite disappointed when I couldn't connect to Gaana/ Saavn/Hungama. I looked up online for help but that also didn't help. Finally I used the feedback feature and got immediate reply from Amazon. In the device settings they changed it from Amazon.com to Amazon.in, and asked me to restart the device..basically turn it off and on. I did and and just had to say Alexa play this song from Gaana and it started playing. The gadget has good voice recognition. Though sometimes when the music volume is high it may not do so. You can also enable skills for radio specifically I am talking about AIR radio channels. There are many skills which can be enabled and the reviews in the skills can help you to understand if the skills actually work or not the way you expect it too. Hope this review helps you."

C.L. Verma,5,India,28-09-2020,FALSE,0,size to sound ratio is just excellent,"The size to sound ratio is just excellent, the emphasis seems to be on voice but the base is absent so this is not for the base head.This is the most responsive voice integration that I have seen, as you say, Alexa, it starts listing. There are a lot of things that you can ask Alexa like adding a product in your Amazon cart, open rain sound, play music, set alarm, etc.The interesting thing is that Alexa also listing commands in Hindi as well. This is only a part of the home automation system. All the smart equipment/products you purchase can be connected with Alexa like a light bulb to control it with voice etc. but for that, you need a router in your home.ConclusionThe speaker does not have a battery but he can be connected via Bluetooth from your phone and PC. Which is a good thing but all of a sudden it stops playing for no reason which is very annoying?I got it in INR 2500, at this price you must buy it, just to experience a smart speaker but in INR 3500 it looks a bit expansive.

In fact the only available services are Amazon music, Saavn and Hungama music2. Amazon music has a very limited catalog and Indian users can't upload their songs either ( apparently US users can do this)3. Spotify not available ""yet""4. Youtube/ Google play music not supported for obvious reasons5. Because of the above I tried to give Saavn a shot as their catalog is surprisingly large, but then Alexa doesn't support playlists for Saavn.Summary:If you are planning to get an Echo for listening music - stay away from this (or any Echo device for that matter) - at least for now."

You have to say Alexa before every question which could be little annoying some times.What it can do?You can play songs for sure, ask questions and it answers you for most of the times, set alarm, alerts. create routine Etc.But I use it mostly for listing songs and alarms and does a good job.Only negative thing that I can say as of now is its bit difficult to give commands at higher volume you really have to shout but in normal it can pick thinest of sound.So all in all its value for money as I got it @2999 in sale."

However, Alexa has to learn a lot before getting five stars. Secondly, Alexa understands English. There are many other features which are not understood by a general user. Thirdly, in order to make a smart home and make Alexa a hub of such a home requires a lot of money. Those features can only be placed under the review when they are arranged.However, even then, I will recommend to buy it. For 4000 rupees you get good music and less botheration provided the internet strength remain consistence. I feel discouraged when the red line rotates on the device. Even then, buy it and make it a part of your setup."
Monisha,1,India,17-11-2019,FALSE,2,Thumbs down for Amazon echo dot,"It's malfunctioning. For first two days it worked for, later started to malfunction that includes not stoping the music while playing, not responding to commands properly, for first two days it was working really fine , all of a sudeen it stopped taking commands and more even stopped responding . It had to turn it on and off a couple of times, initially it works fine for one command , later it stops responding. I bought it during Amazon big festive sale, may be I ve been given a defective piece or so !!!!! Very bad ...lost interest on Amazon products !!!"

Truly amazing.
Pravesh Bhardwaj,4,India,18-10-2020,FALSE,1,Pack a punch!,"Superb AI device coupled with great speakers. The first impression might seems like underpowered, but the sound quality & volume packs a punch. Children love it. It is able to understand most of the stuff & respond quickly.

The Tech Star Shahrukh,5,India,10-11-2018,FALSE,1,Loved it.. Totally Worth Every Penny.,"Must have product, got it for only 2999 and its awesome. At first I used bluetooth speakers worth Rs. 2000 then i thought why not spend 1000 more and Buy Alexa, and it really paid off.. it also works like a Bluetooth Speaker if not connected to internet, and once you connect it to wifi it becomes Smart Assistant which can control your smart devices or do many things.Sound out put is loud and has bass two, while color looks best for me and the ring sorroundinv body gives it better look. Its total worth it, Amazing Value for Money."
Shreya,5,India,19-09-2020,FALSE,1,Helpful and Smart,"I got this as a gift and it reminds me of everything, connects to my meditation app and also plays loud music. You can also have a fun discussion, play games, etc. The wipro bulb which comes along with it is a boon too as I don't have to reach for the switch anymore, when I'm too sleepy. It's great. I guess Alexa is learning and getting better because she still can't understand some questions, but other than that it's all great"
C.R.Balasubramanian,2,India,13-04-2019,FALSE,1,Utter rubbish product,"Had high hopes for this product after seeing reviews from so many positive feedbacks from customers but was utterly disappointed as it failed to deliver what it's supposed to do.Voice interaction is utter rubbish as its not able to grasp the Indian slang and finding music through it is a pain.Content is not that great and integration with Alexa app is not that smooth. Not able to set customized tone for alarm and lots of other drawbacks.To Sum it all, it's waste of 3500 valuable bucks as there's no easy way to throw it off."
Krishna Dasa,4,India,16-10-2019,FALSE,2,Nice little assistant,"Great product. Awesome build quality. Sound quality drastically improved when compared to 2nd Gen.Speaker doesn’t have general conversational capability. For eg:Alexa How is the weather tomorrow?Alexa: The weather tomorrow is ......Alexa how about day after tomorrow?Alexa: Sorry I am not sure.This is where Google Home mini trumps Echo.On the other hand, if you are invested in Amazon’s ecosystem like Kindle, Prime Music, Fire Stick, this is a great buy. Also good for home automation.Comes with a mute button for the privacy conscious."
Sriram,1,India,22-10-2020,FALSE,1,One star for the Hardware and nothing for the Software!,"Bad software! Alexa is not smart at all.voice recognition is not accurate most of the times but more than that Alexa interpretation leaves lot to be desired. Alexa is a just NLP and works on plain if else or a switch condition rather than being smart device. No where follows the user pattens, voice patterns and the people to come up with suggestions. Most of the times you get fed up with the results and then switch off the device. Mostly none of the songs I want will be played, I end up using it for casting the music from the phone, which anyways normal Bluetooth speaker will do at a less price.Hardly any useful tricks as they call it!Just works as voice command based device rather than a smart speaker!"
Dr. AKS,1,India,21-07-2019,FALSE,3,Making fool of customers,"I'm writing this review because Amazon sold us echo dot with syska smart led light and claimed that it will work with alexa but they are wrong, its horrible smart led from syska , very difficult to setup and to connect with your smartphone.

It has live my Bose speaker system which was getting dust due to either connect to aux cable with mobile or connect to traditional way.3. My kids loved this and started talking to Alexa in tooti footi English language, but after some time they started framing the sentence before talking to Alexa, cool thing.4. Some of the features are very good like songs, news, shopping list, todo list and reminders etc. hope to continue getting more features into it."
Leen Joshi,1,India,01-05-2019,FALSE,5,Huge disappointment,"Honestly, please don't buy this product. Better to purchase a Bluetooth speaker and play the songs manually. I bought this with excitement to gift someone, but it didn't work as expected. It was my luck that I tried it first before gifting, & the experience was pathetic. Initially you will like calling Alexa, but again and again you will get bored. OK no problem, that's the feature. But main issue is it doesn't even play the latest popular songs. Huge disappointment.. I asked to play one song in front of my family, but it started some other music (that was very bad), & then I decided to return it back because I don't want to get insulted. People will laugh on you when you ask calling alexa alexa and it won't play your song."
Ravi,1,India,28-10-2019,FALSE,3,Alexa with lot of restriction,"It is useless device and waste of money it only work with registered WiFi with amazon not with in coming signal of the Alexa app computer or mobile , no one else in the house can use it if registered WiFi is not available and at the same time we can not register two ,three signals . Alexa becomes use less when there is no internet , and there are lot of restrictions like hand free not available when in battery saver mode etc etc . at many a times it can not understand your voice and there are many app's missing in window computer .if i instruct it to teach Gramer to children it can not do . what a useless device it is , i even wanted to buy Fire TV stick but lots of them in used market ,hence i thought there must be some problem like this in that also hence stopped its purchase .My advice to Amazon is make it user friendly . do not restrict to one WiFi signal ,Take the in coming signal or allow us to register two ,three signal there should not restrict Hand free etc .With RegardsRavishankar"
ashok,5,India,27-10-2020,FALSE,1,unique product,Product is good but if a perforated box had been given then it would have been good so that we could have ensured that there is no dust entry and when we operate it because of perforations sound should not be a problem and also the box should have a provision to insert the plug.In this way we could have kept in a place where there is no dust entryMay be for futureregards

It seamlessly connects with my sony srs x11 speakers. Sound quality is 8 out of 10. But when streams to sony speakers it shows the great bluetooth quality. My daughter asks funny questions and it tries to answer else just says "" i dont know"". My family likes Alexa and have fallen in love with it. Alexa app is also very versatile. Go ahead.

My return window is already closed.Secondly, song searching on Gaana app is very poor. I am very fond of Riya's Retro, but Alexa can search only season 1 and moreover it doesn't recognize different episodes of season 1 either. Means if you have already gone through 4-5 episodes of Riya's Retro and want to listen to the next episode, you have to start from episode 1 and then have to skip the episode you have already gone through. It takes hell lot of time to play the next episode after you give the voice command ""Next"".AMAZON SHOULD REPLACE MY ECHO DOT."

aseem,3,India,15-07-2020,FALSE,0,Fun device. Good music volume. Yet mechanical,"1. Size is small, Looks good in home, material is good2. It can fill your entire room with good volume of music. Volume vs size of device is really good.3. Alexa sound is mechanical, we're still 3-4 years earlier for a natural sound of robot in such devices.4. Can't expect latest GK questions / smart / complicated 2 sentences combined queries, bcoz results are per google search and google can't put logics in queries yet as it's mostly keyword relevance matching. So, overall experience is still mechanical.5. Music library it connects to are Saavn and it doesn't have good music for night sleep, it keeps repeating it.6. It blindly plays what the apps give it to play, like, the mood based music search is not good. It sometimes play songs as per direct matching of lyrics with what we spoke but totally not as per intention at all. Such devices totally needs a smarter search engine which understands intention.Overall small fun device, but I still feel that such devices will take some years to mature and become truly seamless home assistants. But it's for parents and they like it enough :D"
Prasad Shrivatsa,2,India,21-07-2020,FALSE,1,Not for all. Suits teens best.,"Echo Dot is a good speaker and voice recognition is quite impressive. However, Alexa integration is still in the development phase. So be prepared to get frustrated.If you are someone who loves the old classics, you will find Alexa very disappointing. And don't forget, you need Amazon Music's premium account to be able to stream music on Echo Dot. That also means, Akexa will play only that music which is available on Amazon Music. I'm not a big fan of Amazon Music. It does not have much of my kind of music.Alexa also plays from Jio Savn and Hungama. So getting Alexa to play some music is not always a simple task to perform. And a lot of times, you want Alexa to play an album you saw on Amazon Music or Hungama but the voice assistant fails to find it!I don't have complaints about operating smart appliances with Alexa though. It's totally fun.Edit-1: It has been five months since I started using Echo Dot and I still can't easily find the music I love. On this Independence Day I tried to get Alexa play some classic patriotic songs like ""Jahaan Daal Par Sone Ki..."" but no matter what words I used, Alexa kept playing a playlist called ""Ai Watan"" which seemed to have all new songs, none of which I liked. Clearly, the music that Alexa offers has been selected by Amazon keeping in mind today's teens. And this won't change.Update: January 10, 2021Almost two years since purchaseThe device is still as good as it was when bought. However, it seems Amazon has made no efforts to improve their music libraries. Their focus is still only to cater to the youth, not those who love soft soulful music. When I ask Alexa to play songs but Md. Rafi, for example, she will only play noisy ones like ""Chaahe koyi mujhe jungle kahe..."". She will never include songs like ""Ik haseen shaam ko dil mera kho gayaa..."" even if the song is available in Amazon Music. The Amazon team thinks only college goers listen to its music. This is one of the reasons why I can not recommend Amazon's voice assisted speakers to friends."

Reshma Arjun,1,India,29-09-2019,FALSE,3,Alexa the dumb,"Amazon thinks that we are duffer's coz I bought this product a few weeks back at 3999 and now during amazon sale the same product is available at 1999 and that's a whopping difference. Just coz they are manufacturing these, they cannot do such a huge injustice to their buyers by dropping price to half......This is a very bad trend and definitely bad service by amazon. Wrt device....I suppose alexa is one of those dumbest virtual assistants that has very limited functions n the most usual casual response from it is ""sorry I don't know that"" . Please don't buy this product.....This is my sincere suggestion."
shashank,5,India,21-11-2020,FALSE,1,Totally Amazed,"This is just awesome.There are so many things we can do with this device and that made me wonder that why this is so cheap.I got a smart bulb with the device in just 2500 rs.Now I control my bluetooth speaker, my tv(firestick) and my bedroom light with my voice commands.This is fun for my 4 years old kid too and Alexa tell stories to him.The voice recognition is very good and the proof is that even my kid's commands Alexa recognise."
Darayus E.,5,India,09-09-2020,FALSE,0,The future is now!,"Simply great product. Well built and very worth it. The voice recognition is great and works as intended most of the time. It keeps getting better as you use it. The sound really surprised me for its size. It's definately not a premium sound but it's still very bassy and loud, and full volume there is noticible disturbunce. The home automation part is what really makes this worth it though. I have my lights, tv and ac connected (using oakter remote) and ofcourse it's also an alarm, an intercom, a music player, a smart assistant and so much more. Life changing tech this is. I also like that you can command it in hindi and english. The conversations to be had are funny and almost natural. Software updates can/should make it even better. Wish it also had battery back up though, that's its biggest flaw. Soon I'll connect many other electronics in my house to alexa by way of smart switches."
Pawan Lohani,5,India,09-11-2019,FALSE,0,Make your home smart with this great choice. Highly recommended. Superb.,"Make your home smart like this smart Echo Dot. Thankyou Amazon for giving us such a great product. I am so happy with this deal. This is really a smart and improved speaker for richer and louder sound and it fits perfectly into small spaces. Very goodVoice control for our music. But the main thing is that we should have strong Wi-Fi connection for proper functioning and one more weak point is It has Stream music from Amazon Prime Music, JioSaavn, and Gaana only. Loving points are we have to just Ask Alexa to play music, answer questions, read the news, check the weather, set alarms, control compatible smart home devices so my family even my little son loves it a lot and it Built with multiple layers of privacy protections and controls, including a microphone off button that electronically disconnects the microphones. Alexa is skill based, overall it's a great deal. Don't think more just go for it."
Anmol,5,India,24-10-2020,FALSE,1,Review after 2.5 months usage. It's a great purchase for me.,"I felt the sound quality is great at the price of 2249 during sale. The alexa integration is really good with all the amazing alexa skills available in echo dot. The voice recognition is average coz when the volume is above 5 , alexa couldn't recognize the wake word as the music is loud. So, we would require to shout to let her hear the wake word. I hope this might be resolved in the new (4th) generation as the sound will be focusing in 1 direction rather than 360 degrees, this is what i feel through looking at the design. The response time is good but can be improved in thr next generation yet to be released. Overall, this device is worth the purchase at regular price and during the sale it becomes much more worthy at the price of 2249. There are many hidden features in alexa which are not known by the majority customers like explicit filter, treble base and mid-range regulator, talk slow, talk fast, follow-up mode, sing a song, feedback, Horoscope, movie dialogues, quotes, Translation, excellent mind and strategy games, kids games and fun games like Shadow game, Akinator, Bulls and Cows, Guess the number, Music mania, Yes Sire etc. and many more fabulous features. Please do a little search on Google about Alexa Skills and who knows you may be able to discover some great hidden features or a new feature. Also, at regular intervals, please do ask your alexa to check for software updates and update the device. It will allow you to enjoy new features with every update. Although, Alexa may not be the greatest invention but it is definitely the sweetest invention and yes it's becoming smarter everyday. Alexa is not comparable to other devices like google home, google nest, apple homepod, etc. as they have different features and different price segments. If you need a wide range of features and skills for daily use and fun, Alexa devices are the perfect choices. Believe me, even with those flaws i mentioned, Alexa will be a cheer. Just go for it."

On the next day itself it says (return recieved) and it was the mistake of courier service and amazon. But when I called the customer service, they ensured me that the placed it again with the same price. But still the status on my dashboard wasn't updated. So I called to customer service again, and he too said same. After 4-5 days I called again, and now they are saying that nothing is updated and I have to place the order again(with today's price). Then what's amazon prime for?! If they can't sell their own product in a wise way.. So disappointing.it was a gift for my brother. And it delayed again. I need a clear action from Amazon service with this matter."
Kumar,3,India,28-11-2019,FALSE,0,Way to go.,"Well, it certainly does few things but way to go. I don't understand with all the money and talent Amazon has, why they didn't provide simple skill to under stand simple commands like Enter/Select, Go up, Go down etc. so that we can use it proper remote.Pros:1. Lots of fun. You can roast your friend by setting simple routine which can be activated by customized voice phrase and it will respond with your customized messages.2. You can control your TV, FireStick etc but in a limited way.3. Can ask for time while half asleep...it provides many other simple features and some of them are useful too.Cons:1. Doesn't recognize Select, UP, Down and other navigation command. So cannot replace you fire TV remote.2. Misses the command now and then.3. Difficult to give voice command while there are other sounds around like if you are watching TV of listening to music. That's very frustrating as you cannot pause video if sound coming from TV is high."

Through it, you can control your smart bulbs, plugs, smart printers.4. It can answer all your questions. Also it also can speak you name. Just say, 'Alexa what's my name's5. It can tell your Amazon order status, just say, 'Alexa where's my order'6. It can tell weather, set an alarm.7. It is lightweight.8. You can make Skype calls, just link your Skype account in the Alexa app.9. It's price is budget friendly, no other smart speakers available at this price range.It made my daily life easier. Go for it.Thanks to Amazon for bringing this device to us."
Amitava Saha,2,India,20-10-2019,FALSE,0,Not very smart,"I had very high hope for alexa. Howe it turned out to be disappointment. As speaker it sounds great, no doubt about it. Alexa is far behind from Google home. It can do basic stuff like play music, control smart devices, reminders etc. But it falls flat when you try to lookup information. That's where Google assistant excels. Most of the time alexa would simply respond with I don't know where as Google will find that information. I really wanted to like it but alexa is disappointment and I had to return it."

Deepak Agarwal,3,India,27-01-2021,FALSE,0,Somewhat disappointed,"Excellent service provided by the device.. Only problem is with Eco dot 3rd generation device that it’s only launch an app but never plays a video, especially YouTube.. This feature is a very basic one and should be added with this device which will enhance the product services overall.. Please take it as a consideration. Also it should be connected to atleast 2 Firesticks or 2 TV’s in a single home.. This should be the minimum. I am very much sure, if these two features could be added with this device, it will enhance the overall service of the product and will reach to many other people in India and thus increase the sale of the product.."
Ohm,4,India,16-10-2020,FALSE,2,Okay for songs,"Pros: Sound quality is good, hardware and design makes perfect fit.. Hardware quality worth for the money. Automation works well like switching on the light and other stuffs.Cons: Software not upto the par. Apart from Amazon music, other apps like spotify, gaana are not supported upto the mark. Also, tamil and local news are not supported. If you wanna use it for only songs (via amazon music), then I would prefer. So integration needs improvement."
Rahul,5,India,25-10-2020,FALSE,1,Magical experience and awesome product no doubt,What a product.. U think of a song and say it.. Alexa actually can play the exact song to the 100% accuracy.Sound quality is awesome with this small sized powerpack. Romantic and slow songs music are just lovable. Although if u like badhash or some hip hop music. U can use an additonal speaker and connect this to it..Mics are quite sensitive and can take orders from other room. Only at high volume u need to yell still not but a concern though.Product build quality excellent.Just an amazing product. U will sure love it.Day 10 and still exploring it. My kid loves to interact with it and ask almost anything and he is excited.
S. Fadnis,5,India,28-02-2020,FALSE,0,Loving it - worthwhile device to have at home,"Alexa has become an indispensable utility for my digital workplace at home - for setting up reminders, alarms, helping me keep up with my appointments, locating my phone when I lose it inside the house, giving weather updates and yes playing songs to keep the mood uplifted. This device is worth every penny for the integration with amazon music and sound quality alone, and the additional integrations provide for a very rick user experience.PS: I have never used google home mini, so this is not a comparative opinion."
Sab,1,India,02-10-2019,FALSE,2,Go for Google home instead,"Better go for Google home..- cannnot make/accept phone calls (only Alexa calls)- cannot place orders on prime now- connected to Samsung smart TV via smart things skill and it can only do basic control like on/off,volume control.-technical customer care is not that good for any support issue.Free Wipro smart light isn't really smart..once power resumes after a power cut you need to switch it off again via app/Alexa.Only worthy use of echo is unlimited music from Amazon music."

Sam,5,India,08-01-2021,FALSE,1,Beats Google Mini Hands down !!!,"This is one of the best Smart speakers available right now with the best AI.Amazon is far far ahead of Google Mini in this race. i have both the devices and have used them side by side and i can tell you, Alexa will understand and answer 70-80% of what is thrown at it. It can play music (i use amazon music & spotify) with ease. Control your devices (i use a few wipro smart bulbs and plugs). it works like a charm.The voice recognition is super and the voice quality is good.Google mini sounds more robotic.Very happy with the purchase.

There are many skills such as ""panda rescue"" and story telling which they can enjoy.MUSIC is the best part of it, if you love music then you can explore lots of songs, uninterruptedly. Speaker quality is quite good.Moreover, I was surprised to to see that alexa can also control the FireStick tv. It can search, play, pause, rewind, forward, at least in primevideo, netflix and youtube. Loved this feature, completely hands-free ""alexa + FireStick"" experience"""
Ganesh,4,India,29-10-2018,FALSE,4,In Love With This Product❤️,"Till Now i am so happy with echi dot 3.It do all basic task likeSeting Timer,Clock,playing Music from amazon music or savan,searching from internet,math calculation etcSond Is FADU 😁😁I Love Its design Very impressiveSome times she automaticaly responce. LolSo manh Skill are avilable you can activate it from alexa app."
Kindle Customer,5,India,24-11-2020,FALSE,0,The most powerful addition of AI to your life,"It's simply amazing. Before I bought it, it sounded like a simple music player to me, but this is much more than that. When you are alone, it can be your best companion. It's a great learning tool for kids and a device that can replace various functions of your mobile phone. You can use it to play meditation music when you get up in the morning and it will help you attain focus. In short, it simplifies the search options on the Internet and helps you live a smart lifestyle."
Tuxanlee,2,India,23-05-2019,FALSE,2,A bit disappointing experience,"Kind of works, but not enough. Product make and the sound quality are good. Aux-out was a major reason to choose Alexa over G-Home. Basic stuff like alarm/timer etc are okay. But that is it.Many times the device doesnt listen to me, specially when it is playing music. And I end up calling 'Alexa"" 3-4 times going closer each time to get the 'attention'. If I had to go all the while to the equipment to say 'Next' or 'reduce volume', what is the benefit over any normal music player !And when it listens, it recognizes wrong atleast half of the time. Initially I thought it is with the regional language (song/movie name), but then found the problem with perfect English dictionary words also (Mercury as Fury and MP3 as MPA). My accent must be really bad !So basically i have to struggle for minutes to get an intended song played.I did get the PLEX server setup in my PC to stream local music to alexa. Not at a level of selecting songs with voice commands yet, but atleast I get a playlist of my choice played.Most of the time I have to use specific commands itself. Natural Language Processing seems far far away. You will need a lot of patience to deal with Alexa !"
Amazon Customer,3,India,12-02-2022,FALSE,1,Super product,"Very nice product, this was my first experience with alexa, overall recognisation and sound quality is good , but it is not pairing with my VU smart TV.Pros:Sound quality was too goodNo lag or delay in responseCons:-Should work with DC power also with battery backup, always we have to connect with AC power.-Without current you can't use this echo dot- listed very few Android TVs (example VU smart tv is not in the list)-Should enhance on 'Schedule to play any song by scheduled time"

Hari Om,4,India,29-07-2021,FALSE,1,😤 After 3 months!👇🏻,"After 3 months here are the things which I found.Works better if you have connection of minimum 20 mbps.I have started to get few bugs or software issue.Alexa listens sometimes by itself and says, 'sorry, I don't know that.'Sometimes songs stops playing in middle by itself.It doesn't recognise voice even after activating it many times.After command it doesn't follow.Disconnects and reconnects network by itself.The sound has decreased, now at volume level 3 I can't hear music properly after 3 meters range. (Have same background noice of fan/Vehicles)Amazon please send a software update which solves these.Thanks!"
Yogesh Hindoliya,5,India,18-07-2019,FALSE,1,Brilliant product,"So, I bought this off Prime day sale along with a Syska 9W Smart LED Bulb (which is the most stupid product ever).Anyway about Echo Dot. I am a software developer myself and I work day-in day-out with AI and ML products. I must say the quality and the capabilities of Echo Dot + Alexa are just mind boggling. I can understand the amount of work that has gone into it's development. Amazing Product. If you really want a good personal assistant, please do but this.There is a limited set of things Alexa can do but for professionals, it's really great at whatever it does including but not limited to organising your tasks, appointments as well as reminders.As for the ""Smart"" Syska LED that came with the package, that product is ultimate disgrace to the brand. It's such a disgrace that it's review I have to write here because Amazon has shut down reviews on the actual product. FMLCheers,Y"
Dinesh,4,India,21-11-2018,FALSE,4,Good one.......,"Purchased during sale in Rs. - 2500/- so got very good deal. but received after almost 15 days.- First time Connection to WiFi network is headache. You need a separate WiFi network. It don't get your own mobile WiFi /hotspot.- Product is good.Nice sound quality. Good looks. But needs power connection always. Must have provided with a small battery , to support backup while shifting from one power source to other.- Ask for Amazon Prime membership for some songs.- Product is a fun toy for Kids of age below 15 years."

Vikram,2,India,26-07-2020,FALSE,1,Not happy with Amazon service,"I was very excited about this purchase and very happy that I got delivered one day advanced and I tried setting up Alexa but ended up unsuccessful for almost 6 hours. Then decided to call Customer service I requested for call back on 7.05pm evening and I call from them on 7.06pm which was amazing and prompt service. The Agent whom I spoke to was Mr. Sami, he was so polite, professional and spoke to for 45 minutes and finally came to know by the agent that the product which I got was reported as stolen or missing product, So that is why I couldn't complete the set up process. I was completely surprised & confused that how come a very big firm like Amazon can deliver a stolen product to their customers and the agent managed to replaceml the product and he gave me end to end service. I was happy with customers service not with Amazon service"

Surash,1,India,15-03-2020,FALSE,2,1st Gen American Version was 100 times better than this,First generation American version of this Alexa Dot was far better than the current Indian version.It doesn't search from Google.For most of the questions that I ask it says I don't know.My first generation American version was doing lot of different things. This one doesn't do much of the things that I need.Sometimes this device goes in to frozen mode for uknown reason.
Certified Customer,1,India,13-06-2020,FALSE,2,No replacement done for faulty echo dot,"No replacement done to my faulty Alexa product by Amazon , They felt apology and committed such ignorance will not happen again , if you guys are okay with this apology then must go on and trust it , One time you must feel helpless as Me , this is real story and nothing cosmetics, I have wasted my 3k and thrown out the devices as its useless , on repetitive complain by calling and Via social media they only able to convince me to not happen this issue again , Yes they are still investigating and given choice of refund , which means get refund with older price and buy on current higher price which is baseless , also they had given one choice to purchase again with higher price and then they will refund all amount during exchange ,,, in short I have loose trust on amazon on their customer handling approach so cant take risk again chosing any option, replacement policy is straight forward and they must has to comply it first ,,, disappointing experience with amazon on replacement management,,,"
Abdur Rehman,5,India,17-03-2020,FALSE,1,A lot of pros with little of cons.,"Echo dot has really nice and premium design and sound. Compact yet powerful with room filling sound. It's four far field microphones makes the Alexa experience quite impressive. It is better than google mini home overall, Like it has beeter sound quality better response with natural voice and room filling sound. It has really many features and there are list of pros. But there are two things which disappoints me that first is it's voice recognition. It answers anyone. Secondly you can't make calls from Alexa within India. but well Alexa is adding skills on the daily basis."
Vijay pratap singh,4,India,23-07-2021,FALSE,3,Review after a year usage,Product was good but it was only for few months? After 1 year as warranty expired it stopped working suddenly and not even showing power sign or a blink. No idea how to get it repaired. Any option for trade-in for this please let me know
George,2,India,25-10-2021,FALSE,0,Expensive Smart Speaker,"Expensive, Smart speaker works only when plugged in. Bluetooth V2.0 is very old dur to this audio is very poor, sound becomes very low. No battery to support the speaker so if no power you cannot use the device. Sometimes while song change you hear a distorted sound. Not worth the purchase as Bluetooth quality in the speaker is bad. You need to shout then only Alexa can hear you - voice sensor is poor. On full volume Alexa will not recognise your command."

Zahid A.,5,India,17-10-2019,FALSE,0,Amazing Product with Wipro Smart Bulb Combo (Festival Offer),One of the best deals one can get during Festival Offers!!!- Very very good sound quality as compared to other mini audio devices- Got a combo offer Alexa compatible smart bulb from Wipro worth Rs 2000 (approx) absolutely free- Must buy as nowadays homes are really transforming into smart homes- Connects with my Obage BT speakers and works absolutely awsome- Need extra caution while connecting to the Network as if you miss any steps will need to re-start all over. But thats with me as I am not a very tech savvy person
Anand Singh,4,India,01-01-2022,FALSE,1,In love with it,"My only disappointment is that it does not have battery and when power goes off it dies.Sound quality is very good, good bass but not like woofer.It can be used as Bluetooth speaker. But not sure if Bluetooth earphones works with it. Will update about it later."
Criston,5,India,05-03-2022,FALSE,0,Worthy Alexa speaker at the price range I got.,I got a discount of 1000 for this product during some flash sale and got the product at Rs. 2499. It originally costs 3499. So to buy at this price is a awesome deal. I really appreciate amazon for selling products cheaper than the original cost. These are very friendly and reliable devices that can help you to track any orders or set up an alarm or sing a song on any occasion. Every thing I tried and it works wonder. Definitely a must buy for young people who want to be smart in their day to day activities.
RT,4,India,02-08-2019,FALSE,0,Powerful speaker than its predecessor.,"Edit after using for one month.Initially I had hurdles in getting it to wake with our wake word. Due to less sensitive mic than its predecessor. But had received instructions from Amazon team to factory reset my device, following which the performance is better.Giving four stars... as opposed to one star earlier.(Original review) Disappointed with 3rd Gen ... Switched back to old Echo DotI was very happy with Echo Dot old version plastic black one with only concern being speaker volume is limited. Brought this one 3rd Gen and found its voice recognition to be very bad than its predecessor. Often I had to shout to make it listen giving rise to a lot of nuisance to others around and throat pain. Also its sound was very Bassy...Overall I was very disappointed and switched back to my good old Echo Dot 2nd gen."
Sherlock Holmes,5,India,16-08-2020,FALSE,1,Good one to receive and obey command ;),"Feels nice to have someone(thing) whom I can command! Feeling myself to be royal to order Alexa to okay music, switch in and off light Andreas news.Sound quality of the speaker is decent (better than google home mini) but connectivity is great.It can understand regional language inputs efficiently. For example, I asked it to okay certain Bengali songs with difficult names, but it efficiently played them.I have prime so it is good to get prime music there as well."
Amit Kulshrestha,5,India,18-08-2020,FALSE,0,Alexa! How was the day today?,"Your journey in to the world of smart speaker starts and ends with Alexa. If you are sitting on the fence, still undecided and full of dilemma, get your act together, jump over and buy this bundle of joy.Once you are used to the world of Alexa, your life will change with unexplored experiences.The Alexa integration is a breeze with the new Alexa App, both of iOS and Android. Since this smart device works on cloud, it is never going to be outdated but for some delayed firmware updates.However if you are looking at this from an audiophile perspective, try out the larger Amazon echo for its phenomenal sound prowess.However for me the amazon echo dot 3rd generation is a perfect mix of an excellent Smart device with a reasonable good sound which lets you differentiating the low, mids and highs of your favourite songs. Welcome to the world of Alexa!"
Akhil P Walia,5,India,20-10-2020,FALSE,0,Great as a Smart Hub and Voice Assistant,"I did a lot of research and after much deliberation, I finally decided to go with Echo dot Gen 3 over Google Nest. I have to say, I am totally loving this. I have connected it to my Smart TV, Fire TV, Wipro Bulbs, Camera and Smart Sockets. Overall, I am satisfied and the device is working as expected. The only minus point is that the power cable is using old-style pin connector instead of mini USB which is more a universal standard."

Until used with amazon family its good but, if you want only a smart speaker then go for google home mini nest version you will be very happy. Alexa is just a very weak ai in front of google"
Amazon Customer,1,India,02-10-2019,FALSE,2,This is like fishing by Amazon.

After that what ever I command to Alexa only reply is, this is for prime members.Expect whether report this device don't deliver anything.Planning to return it tomorrow.Please don't get into traps like this.Today they are telling to be a prime member tomorrow they may say upgrade it by paying some money.Thanks Amazon for trapping me. But I won't let others to get trap."
Nikunj,1,India,07-09-2021,FALSE,1,Needs an improvement,"After one and half years, crackling sounds from a speaker automatically comes in an audio system. You cant fix it unless it get exchanged. The warranty period for this product is one year so, you cant even exchange this. Try to fix it or the company should mention this drawback, which appears in every alexa echo dot. I have 3 echo dots of 3rd generation. Now, all have the same situation. So, i have connected speakers to the alexa externally but this should not be the solution.Plz have a look if the review of the products do matter to you. Plz fix it."
SVG,5,India,28-02-2019,FALSE,1,Fab product,"I loved loved loved Alexa. She is super fun and understands most of what I say. Though there are some things which are foreign to her.Easy to install, easy to use. There are instructions given. Follow them and you are good to go. It just took me ten seconds and I am not very tech savvy.The only thing which I didn't like is that Alexa read out books only from Kindle unlimited or which I have bought from Amazon. It did not read my other documents aloud. It didn't recognize my other novels on my kindle. Hence I was a bit disappointed.On the whole a fun product.After a few monthsSometimes Alexa does not understand me and she says she is stumped. Which made me laugh... But I suppose it's possible."
Saurbh,2,India,08-09-2019,FALSE,1,Not satisfied,Alexa speaker is good sound is also good but their is problem with aux port which is not working from first month i didn't use the aux port in first month after a month I was checking Alex booklet and I read that in alexa there is a aux port also I tried to use it but it's not working and than I call to Amazon they didn't help about that I don't know why they just give me a customer support email I am disappointed with Amazon they should solve this problem by phone call
amar prasad,4,India,09-12-2018,FALSE,3,"A smart speaker, that isn't smart!!","[1 & 1/2 months Review] Sound iQuality(Bass, Treble, mids) are awesome for Music. Has no connection issues whatsoever. But is a terrible let down if looking for smart capabilities , mostly coz Alexa isn't as smart or conversive like the Google assistant. It's a smart speaker which isn't really smart. If your looking for music only that then go ahead,but then if your only looking for music go in for JBL or other Bluetooth speakers. Else go for Google home mini. Had to spend a lot of time making Alexa smart with combination of autovoice and tasker"
Praveen Tyagi,5,India,24-10-2020,FALSE,1,My first Smart Speaker,My first Smart SpeakerThis was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English
s.p m.,5,India,16-10-2019,FALSE,1,Excellent job Amazon !,"The sound quality is top notch , Alexa talks back in Hindi and makes us smile .. It is even better than google home mini in terms of sound quality .. The light Rim looks really very nice , The build quality is very premium , It catches my voice very easily even if I speak very low , It has the most realistic Voice compared to any other Assistants , It Amazes everyone who visits my home , and the best part is that it speaks Hindi so well and even understands 70% of the commands in Hindi , And in future It's Hindi will definitely improve , This thing worth ⭐ the money .."
Anuj Sharma,3,India,27-11-2019,FALSE,0,"Alexa, do I need you?","I truly don’t see the point behind Alexa or any smart speaker for that matter.I finally bought it coz it was on offer during sale and I just wanted to see what the fuss was about and I was right, there’s nothing great about a smart speaker.There’s nothing much you can do with it and the charm & novelty wears off quite soon. More of a gimmick than an actually useful gadget.Don’t get me wrong, the product is good but I really don’t see its utility. Buy with your own wisdom & utility."
R Krishnamoorthy,5,India,17-10-2021,FALSE,3,Good product,Very useful to eradicate the lonely feeling at all times. Can hear any type of songs what we like.
dj,1,India,28-12-2020,FALSE,1,Buy a Bluetooth speaker,"Doesn't respond to 'alexa' a lot of times, have to shout it. Finding music is very difficult we ask something it plays something else, doesn't play different versions of song if available, doesn't take feedback on content. A lot of improvements needed. Sound quality is good. But better to buy a Bluetooth speaker, because it will become frustrating shouting alexa and anyways there is no battery so portability is low."
Shantanu Mondal ,2,India,15-08-2019,FALSE,0,For Indians there is nothing,"There is nothing for Indians. Searching capability is so poor that you will get irritation. Also listening power is very low. We need to go closer to speaker to say something. Only selected songs and videos can be get through this that are listed in Amazon Music or Amazon Video. You cannot expect hindi rhythms or hindi old melody separately. Some play list they have created, only that can be played.Today on 15th August I'm returning this after one command that I give - play independence day song, you will get the result once you purchase the Alexa"
Abhishek,5,India,27-10-2019,FALSE,0,Buy it without second thought.,"This is one of the best speakers you will get own. The response is improving everyday and the skills are polished continuously. Don't go by the reviews of negetive people as they have a bad accent and then blame it on the speaker, however Hindi is also supported now.Just buy it when you get a deal as I got a free bulb with it.You have to spend a little if you want to be at par with the technology. Since Jio Savan is fully supported you therefore need not get the prime membership in case that is what you are afraid of."
Hemant kumar,1,India,26-10-2019,FALSE,2,"Don't fall for ads, it sucks!","Very poor skills and doesn't even make calls despite being connected to the phone and everything enabled. Doesn't control Firestick as advertised. Doesn't control Smart lights as shown in TV ads. Keeps turning off every now and then midway during playback. Software is bad, very bad. My phone's Google assistant is much better than it. This piece of junk is too loud in voice of alexa, and too low in music playback. The so called brief mode has never worked. Don't waste your money, buy a speaker instead."
Manesh Kallil,1,India,27-04-2020,FALSE,2,Alexa is not efficient to play any malayalam songs,"Writing again since I am totally unsatisfied with Alexa and it became a useless item for me . Unable to add skills pertaining to choice of music . When i bought Alexa, lot of expectations , but it is not at all impressive on various areas, like when I ask Alexa to play malayalam songs , based on movies,singers,by song name, it is always gives an answer sorry I could not see any song. Same stands with Tamil and to an extend hindi songs as well.Google Home is much smarter and better choice than Aelxa. I strongly suggest if Amazon is not fixing this basic issues and needs of many in India, you may always got a better option 'Google Home'."
ADITHYA EN,5,India,15-12-2019,FALSE,2,E.T. phone home,"The Amazon echo is cool and all, but I had a weird experience with the one I got. Once I connected the echo dot, I got to overhear various extra-terrestrial communications. Figured out this much so far... In a galaxy far far away, there was a kid named martin, who is somewhat bevvied and is trying to establish a contact to his home C-137. His communication was successful, his mother, Bethany, picks up the contact. Now he is trying to tell her a story...the story of how he killed an old man named Richard. He is hurt, he cries in agony while narrating a story to her...He is heard to be repeatedly calling his maternal deity while explaining what and how he did it. Then I guess he gets surrounded by some sub intellectual species called the geralds. They ganged up on the kid and is chasing him down.. the communication abruptly ended ended when a voice of an old man is calling up on the kid..while the kid still running for his life, lastly heard screaming his maternal deity name while nonchalantly establishing how nothing really matters to him..."
utk787,1,India,20-10-2019,FALSE,2,A big flaw for indian market,"Using a proprietry power connector for power supply is a big flaw for indian market, where power outage is common, I have my speakers and modem connected with a ups and i am forced to keep alexa at the same place where it doesnt pickup my voice most of the time. A Micro usb port would have been better. I can connect a powerbank to it to make this device portable. In that sense i think google mini is better"
Indian Tech Advice,4,India,19-11-2020,FALSE,0,I Gave 4 out of 5 Star,"This is the first Echo I have owned. So far I am loving everything that it does from to do lists to news updates and linking my calendar to playing music. It is very convenient and hopefully in the future I will buy more products for it to control like my thermostat and lights. That being said I am wondering why in the world, it being an amazon product, does it not control my amazon fire stick! This is so fustraiting and I hope that amazon will come out with an update soon that will allow the echo to have this option! It seems like it can literally control everything except for the fire stick. This is why I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars."
Bakul T,3,India,28-02-2020,FALSE,0,No parental controls,No parental controlsWe got this as a gift for our child so that she could request her own songs or ask questionsYou can label this as the kids room device but it has absolutely no way to configure age of the person who will be using itI see this as a glaring gap. I believe Google home has it. The Kindle has it. I know Alexa kids edition has been released in the USBut the expectation here is to just allow parental controls to be kept onVery disappointed with this basic miss
Amit,5,India,01-10-2019,FALSE,1,Alexa rules,"I was not sure why i need this until I bought it.like :1. sound quality2. can control my TV and other things.3. can place orders , know current news etc.dislike :1. I am looking for a led bulb with atleast 2300 lumens and some other items but most of them are still not available in market. (9-14 watt in not serving the purpose)2. can't use it at all in case of internet connectivity issue, it should have some memory area where some songs or other stuffs can be used offline."

Kapil P.,4,India,08-08-2020,FALSE,1,Satisfactory,Used this device for about a couple days now and so far I've observed it can play any English song you ask pretty easy but when asked about a hindi song it either plays a wrong song or it can't understand. Hence asked Alexa to change her language to indian English and Hindi. Now the accent and voice is of a Indian lady and not the original US English accent but still face difficulty in getting it to play the hindi songs I request. But I guess it will learn to recognise my words slowly. Although it's a wonderful device with many uses but it needs to work on getting the right hindi songs.
Rinu Shri Garg,5,India,05-10-2020,FALSE,2,Just one drawback,"The only drawback that it has is that it's non-chargeable. You are supposed to plug in everytime you want to use it. Also, since it has a limited cloud data on which it searches for the songs you are looking for, it sometimes is unable to find some lesser known songs. I tried a few songs, used the name of singer as well, but it wasn't able to find the correct one. Other than that, it's perfect."
Jagveer,5,India,15-10-2018,FALSE,6,Buy it now or regret later.. perfect for home,I got this product delivered on 10th october and was launched on 11october. What a great delivery. The major difference between second generation and third generation echo dot is.. the sound which is very high in echo dot and also it has 5 microphones so even if the music is loud alexa work can be heard easily. At 2999 introduction priceIts a steal deal. Did lot of stuff like booking pkayed quiz beside playing only songs.

She even cannot tell about the search engine she uses. For your information, she using Bing. Yucks!There is only buzz for alexa while google home is far far superior than it. Very bad experience.

Secondly, it does what you ask it to do after several attempts. 75% of the time you have to repeat yourself to get what you ask for.In short, the AIplatform needs to be upgraded or else it’ll just become a Bluetooth speaker."

Does not at all understand the request / order for songs very well. Needed to ask for the song ""500 miles"" for 6 times before getting the right song. Need to develop a lot.#4.

The bluetooth connectivity is no good. it's very difficult to connect to any other bluetooth device. Now coming to the main part of the Echo : voice recognition or rather would say it's integration. The Indian voice is a disaster. Half of the time you will have to repeat even for the simpler terms and words. Half disappointed, else it's good."

RAJITH R.P,5,India,31-07-2021,FALSE,0,Be sure to buy it,"The device is quite unique and affordable. It has 4 mics and a really good speaker. You can set alarms, remainders and literally listen to every song. It uses less data while plugged in and about 100mb per hour to play songs and books. That means it literally uses less than 1-3gb per month. First of all Amazon has one of the best Customer Care services and customer friendly policies."
sreeram v p,3,India,17-07-2019,FALSE,0,Mix of compromises and improvements!,"As a first gen amazon echo dot owner, i thought these would improve the overall experience. But the first thing i noticed after setting it up was the bad speech recognition, while the first gen heard me 8 out of 10 times l, the newer one heard me only like 6 out of 10 times!, but the worst part is that the first gen actually did a better job of recognizing my commands and was more polished than this! While the first gen gave me enough time for me to speak, these would just cut me off if i stuttered while the command,.. They wont give the beep echo dot first had while changing volume.Overall the user experience is downgraded while the build and sound quality improved by a good margin! Hope they will just fix these small issues by just cut n pasting the same echo dot first gen experience or just try to even improve on these unnecessary omissions they made!If they update it, i would give these a easy 5 stars! Great sound, great build, nicely designed,Downgraded user experience!"

Mayapur in Bengal,5,India,13-08-2019,FALSE,0,Old Age Personal Assistant,"This review is at the end of the third week of use. I use the Echo Dot 3rd generation for answering questions, setting reminders, alarms, to-do, and shopping lists. I do not use it very often for music. At my age (over 70) and being retired, a person can be more active and busier than ever before. Often we need to remind ourselves to do things such as taking medicine, do my yoga, keep up with my art class, do my accounting, practice my harmonium or other daily tasks accomplished on a schedule. Many times older people have brief thoughts that we need to remember. Remembering that thing you wanted to buy or do from the other day, of which the memory of that usually occurs in situations such as doing the dishes or taking a shower when your hands are wet so writing it down needs to be put off. Now you can yell at Alexa.I’ve told you how I use the Echo Dot, let me tell you how I feel about this purchase. I can’t believe I waited for so long to buy one of these things. The Echo Dot is a huge help for me; it's like having an assistant. I use Alexa and the Echo Dot many times a day for all of its features, including remembering things that may have otherwise gone undone or forgotten.I speak several languages, including proper English and in the last three weeks, the only time Alexa has not understood what I have said is when I have mumbled, garbled or otherwise mispronounced something. Other than those very few times voice recognition has been perfect. The Echo Dot sits on my desk; however, today I ordered a wall holder (the type without the plug just a holder) to mount it on my bookcase right in front of my home desk. The sound coming from the Echo Dot carries far into my residence and is easily heard and understood from a reasonable distance.I downloaded the Amazon Alexa app for my Android phone. You don’t need to use this app in daily use, but you will use it during device setup and review of what you have voiced onto the Echo Dot for lists, alarms, and reminders. You can also hear those by asking Alexa. And thank goodness you don’t need the Alexa app for more than that. It’s awful. I think the word “awful” is the most used in all the reviews. Almost always your Alexa app will say that your Echo Dot is offline when it is never offline. Most of the studies agree with this. So yes, if you buy an Echo Dot, you will download and use the Alexa app, but after setup, I’ve not found any use for it other than to touch the button on my phone to see when the app works and does not work. My Echo Dot works 100% of the time, and if the internet to the house is working the Echo Dot will be working correctly and automatically.This purchase of the Echo Dot has been a big boost for me. I am happy to have moved forward technology-wise with this device. For anyone who wants more productivity in their life, this is a good buy. And now, I have something to say to Alexa before I sign off: Alexa, wake me up from my nap in 30 minutes.90 day update: See picture of the wood stand. Using daily for everything the Echo is designed to do. Voice recognition near perfect. I can have my back to the Echo from across the room and yell out a command no problem. I've added a couple of Skill Blueprints which have been excellent. I am using many reminders which have been a boon to my productivity. Had a local carpenter make a wood stand made for above my desk to hold the Echo Dot and my camera."

So, no complaints over there.BUT,This is more like a toy to me. The day when I bought this I was very excited to use it but eventually my interest faded and now it is just lying around the house. I use it some times to listen to music nothing more because kab tak aap use weather ya news puchoge ya bate karoge. I even have a fire TV stick to pair it with and use voice commands but it is not perfect search so I end up using remote. I even have a wipro smart bulb but the story remians the same.YOU WILL EVENTUALLY (1 WEEK IN MY CASE) GET BORED WITH THIS TOY."

They keep on listening to music, songs etc but when it comes to News, it switches to NDTV which I hate the most. I do not get choice to listen the News from a Particular Channel which Alexa needs to evolve either by asking the Choice or thru Self Evaluation (given the fact that it hears all the conversation even those which are not being asked for)."

This has communication features so people having alexa app or echo device and permission can actually call you on your echo dot.2. This has announcement features so if you are late for dinner you can announce that on your echo device from your phone.(Actually i use this feature to play ghost sounds when little kids are in my room😝)3. This has best features for home automations that google home or any other devices don't have.4. This has best features for timer tasks.5. Scheduling is much more advanced in alexa app.6. If you say turn on light in front of your kitchen echo dot it will turn on only kitchen lights. so you don't have to be specific like turn on kitchen lights like google home.(you need multiple echo devices for this as obvious)So forgot about google home and just buy it."

Smart speaker for budget friendly customers.The max volume could have been higher. Vol 10 is max and it not very loud, good for a mid-size living room. Need additional speakers for party. Limited amazon music collection and many songs may not be in the list. Also, you need to keepp it on charge at all times to use it, no battery option available at the moment."

Clint Johny ™,4,India,11-08-2019,FALSE,0,I finally got it.,"I have always been a fan of virtual assistants. So when there was amazing offer which gave me e the echo dot along with the syska smart bulb for under 3000 rupees I went for it. Initial impressions it works as advertised however I am not sure if the one or two times I use this on a daily basis to turn off the light it is worth the amount I paid. Is not anything else it works as a smart speaker and you can tell Alexa to play songs at the convince of your voice. It's want to talk to Alexa and laugh at funny responses. Alexa isn't as smart as you want it to be and a lot of you questions are responded with ""I don't know that"".If your locality has a lot of power outages it might be a problem specially sense Alexa takes about a couple of minutes to reconnect if it loses power. It also will not work if you don't have an active internet connection which is a huge bummer. But overall I'm very happy with the purchase and I would recommend others to give it a try as well. I hear some people use it to learn English."

Haven’t tried other portable speakers yet but can’t ask for better sound quality... it’s amazing.2. Easily connected with amazon fire stick .... you command and it serves..like playing any track or movies on amazon prime and Netflix3. Connects with iPhone or android mobile and any Bluetooth speaker and turns your normal Bluetooth speaker of your choice to a smart speaker( used on f&d 6000 using Bluetooth audio adopter)4. Got the combo deal with Wipro 12w smart bulb at 2349 during sale and magic begins.5. At high volume Alexa recognise your voice command like anything.6. Ask Alexa for ordering foods and cab service( although not available to my place) but it gives you proper information.7.

sanskriti prakash,1,India,11-09-2021,FALSE,1,WORST!,"I bought my first smart speaker hoping that it might turn out to be a good experience.Alexa doesn't get the commands properly except for start or stop. I was so annoyed at last, that I started playing via bluetooth.Coming to Bluetooth, It never connects to some devices properly and the one where they are connected to, faces the issue of connecting/ disconnecting or sometimes no sound at all.Not portable at all.Sound quality is fine if played in a room.My overall experience was not too relaxing cuz with this kind of device comes testing of patience."
Ninosha,5,India,09-10-2019,FALSE,0,Nice,"I got it on sale. It's perfect for my room. I've hooked it up by a cable to my Bluetooth speaker. I only wished it worked on battery. Having said that I did have trouble with it once, when it wouldn't connect to the wifi on resetting the device. It took me more than a day to figure it out. The help provided by Amazon Customer services in relation to Alexa devices on speaking to them seemed like I would get a replacement but keep in mind that it's not so, you will be offered a refund but not a replacement as far as my experience is concerned. Thankfully I got my product to work before the agent came to collect it."
Robin Raj,4,India,02-07-2021,FALSE,0,Great product with nice feature but repair of this product is not possible in India,"The product is really good and works fine as per the expectation.Though the proble is once it gets hardware proble as in my case due to fluctuation in power, speaker of my device got damaged. Then I had sent it for repair but in india they can't open the device and repair it hece I was offered to buy refurbished decice at 2000 with just 3 months warranty hence it is like almost paying for a new device with just 3 month of warranty rather than 12 months. Again once 3 month is over for the refurbished device you are on your own if device gets any fault. Hence the vecious cycle of buying refurbished item or new device will continue as there is no option to repair in India. Hence over dependency on this item will invite this unavoidable vecious circle."
inspiration,4,India,21-03-2021,FALSE,0,Good speaker for songs only.,"I'm very happy with my purchase.Initially it feels little bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it.Later on talking to Alexa becomes a part of your daily life.✅Things which I like the most are stated below:👍The sound quality is very good.👍You get good depth of sound.👍You can ask any random questions to Alexa.👍It can speak and understand Hindi and English languages.👍It does play all musics from all languages.👍It can tell jokes.👍I also played KBC with Alexa.❌Things which I don't like are:👎Sometimes it is unable to understand what you said.👎Most of time Alexa reply ""Sorry"" because she don't know the answers of our command/questions.👎It is a good music player but poor assistant.👎It plays certain songs again and again and doesn't let you skip.👎You have to set a play list in your phone or device from which you are operating Alexa. Otherwise you will keep on saying ""Alexa play this song. Alexa play that song.""👎If you won't set any playlist it will stop after every song.👎It is not battery powered.👎has to be kept plugged in all the time."
Dev S.,1,India,16-06-2019,FALSE,2,Not worth the money spend. Takes peace and patience away.,Super poor product. No doubt Amazon has to offer discounts to push it. Previous generation echo was better. Mic quality is pathetic. It does not listen to you if the volume is had been maxed up. Claims about Alexa following commands from other end of room are false. It fails to work from 3 feet as well. Super poor product not worth 10% of its price. Feel Disappointed and cheated
Dr. URVISH MISTRY,5,India,28-11-2020,FALSE,0,A Perfect Device with Minor Inconveniences,"This was my second echo dot purchase. However, everything is similar to the first one, I find this one a tad bit quicker to answer queries. I do not know the reason nor can I find one for it to be.Meanwhile, white color is totally white and can be a bit problem if you're using it in a broad open space which may cause it to get dirty from dust.The voice recognition is perfect. However, like Google Nest Home devices, I would like personalized results from voice identification. That would certainly give these device lineup an edge.Spotify device casting is excellent. I find it faster than Google devices. The sound is a bit muffled though due to side firing (?) speaker. I believe one should go for 4th Gen devices from now on.Home automation is a breeze with these devices. I've set up multi room audio and it's one thing that I can say is worth all the money. You may also set up two dots as stereo speakers too.Overall, this is a great device. Just bear in mind, 4th gen is a remarkable improvement over this one."
Vishi Khandelwal,5,India,25-10-2019,FALSE,1,Great Speaker,"The speaker is great and has great features. The best part is its integration with my Amazon Fire stick. I also have a google home mini and out of both of them, echo dot wins any day. The sound quality and voice recognition is great too. I personally love the multi colour ring light on the top."
Dhiren,3,India,19-09-2020,FALSE,0,There is no difference in New Alexa,"What is improved from the earlier generation? My feeling is Amazon need to enrich skills at the backend and ""any generation Alexa"" could use them seamlessly. Also required is the isolation mode - where in Alexa can be configured to do only specific skills rather than responding to noise (conversation not directed for Alexa - e.g. you are referring to Alexander the Great and Alexa in the room starts speaking and disturbing).."
Indian,4,India,04-11-2019,FALSE,0,"Great product, but still quite dumb","Amazon echo dot is a great product in terms of its sound quality and overall entertainment value. But for practical use it is still quite dumb. For Indians we definitely need to set English and Hindi together. Also many common things it does in a dumbest way. Many Indian songs it doesn't understand correctly. Variations in news, scores, horoscopes, weather are just missing.Long way to go for this technology. In many ways google assistant is better. I hope that same device should allow marriage of all the technologies in this field."
Sidhartha Bitla,4,India,25-05-2019,FALSE,0,Good,Looks wise the product looks amazing. Audio quality is good. Voice Recognition is very bad. Some times if we are so close it won't respond. It has a limited library of songs so it won't give you the expected song to play. If we ask for some favorite song to play it plays some other song. This should be updated. Amazon music should update huge list of songs to resolve the issue.
Pompi,5,India,30-05-2021,FALSE,0,Read this while you decide,"The room has converted into a smart home. But it is a costly affair. First of all you need a wifi connection then you need all smart acessories or appliances to pair with Alexa such as Smart Plug, Smart Bulb, IR Blaster(require in case of non-smart appliance like AC). Overall it gives an esteem feeling. The echo dot 3 is good. But I expected a beter sound from the device."
ac,5,India,08-08-2020,FALSE,2,Worth the money,"Worth the money. Could work better on voice recognition. Otherwise pretty decent.Sound quality is better than what I had expected.Overall, Alexa is a better option than Google home."
Dharma Sriram,1,India,29-09-2021,FALSE,1,"Dont buy, not for long term usage",After one year of usage speaker is not working. Crack sound it's coming. This is happened for my friend too. And service is very pathetic. I have booked service and no one called me back. Better to go for Google one which is very reliable. This is not for long term usage. After completing one year this will
Richard Stane,5,India,31-10-2019,FALSE,0,My home is also smarter now.,"I bought this product for just tryout and mainly because of the offer season trust it me guys its more than a tryout now it controls everything that has a wifi built into it and has a Internet access, not your phone though.But it can make a call to your phone if you install Alexa app into your mobile phone.Control your light plugs and you can even make a call to Alexa to with making changes in your settings of hors and the other persons Alexa device. All this happens just by commanding it through your voice.It truly is a smart device"
Thilak,1,India,15-02-2021,FALSE,1,Noisy sound after 20 days,"I bought this on Jan 25 and it was working great, the voice recognition is good, alexa software sucks and sound quality was also good (not for long). Now its 20 days and the speaker started creating buzzy sounds. At the beginning it was low, but as the time passes, the buzzing sound is also increased. Won't recommend it happily to someone."
Arpit,4,India,03-12-2019,FALSE,0,Smart but not enough,"Alexa is good in understanding the Indian accent and covering Hindi-English language , it does the job of voice assistant in terms of managing devices around... I tried controlling my Denon AVR X2500h with Alexa, it does the basic task of paying song, changing volume, but can't change the music mode etc. Similarly I can control my Airtel Internet TV set top box once set-top box is swith on, it can not swith it on or off.So it gets the work done upto certain extend but not completely.The biggest problem which is see with Echo devices is that it can not get the information from web though it is connected to internet always, for every thing to do it needs skill.Ideally it should go to web to find some basic answers instead of saying ""I don't know"".If anyone wants to use it just for playing music then this is one of the best smart speaker available in market in given price."
Aditya,5,India,03-06-2020,FALSE,0,Happy,"We have been using it for months. Kids love it. Though Echo may not always find the Telugu songs we intend it to play, we can find the song in Amazon music app and play it once, Echo will pick it. We have to give the song details as per the song info showing in Amazon music app. We keep Echo on top of our fridge to keep it out of reach of my 3 year old. Sometimes it will not catch our commands, so we have to turn it so that it's microphone hears our commands clearly. It is good that Echo can read a story to my kid, from the same page we last read in our Kindle. Overall happy with it."
Yashwanth Y V,5,India,31-12-2021,FALSE,1,Very Good Product,The media could not be loaded.  Overall good quality it is baby rhymes songs and also controls geyser doing well with compared to other versions this is economical and technically goodrecommended for others to buy
Tanuj Kumar,1,India,21-08-2019,FALSE,2,Not worth to buy,"Don't buy it and don't get attracted towards the hype about Amazon Echo or Google home. It will not answer to your in general query. And moreover to control your things such as bulb, fan etc you will have to buy those separately that adds additional burden to your pocket. I bought it after hearing a lot about it and I got angry when I felt that it will not work until and unless you connect your Amazon Echo to any wifi network. It also adds another monthly burden to your pocket. Even after spending a lot you will struggle while using it because it will not answer your daily query. I will tell you about my personal experience I asked alexa to remember my birthday and surprisingly it said ""Sorry I didn't know that"". And also I asked alexa to roar like a lion and it did but it was like someone play a low quality audio. I think you would have seen that in one of the advertisement. So last but not the least if you use it regularly you will conclude that you are using Amazon echo just for 2-3 works, playing music (also sound quality is loud but not good) adding alarm and controlling led bulbs if you have bought. So I will suggest you to think wisely because by the time you will decide it is not worth to buy your return period will be over. And if you will ask to me I will say DON'T BUY it rather buy a JBL speaker and it will give you satisfaction whenever you will listen any song."
Praveena,1,India,12-11-2021,FALSE,0,A dumb voice assistant in modern times,"I ordered echo dot hoping it will help me in organizing the daily routines and provide responses to day to day questions especially for kids. Later came to know , most of the features lack the basic intelligence. Alex doesnt understand the context most of the times. you cant ask a question which is linked to a previous query/answer. Many times it tries to find a song only. !!! It acts desgned for a music playbox most time.Getting a song played out that we intent (sung by my fav singer) is almost no way in many cases. Reminders - voice level cannot be set so I end up creating Routines instead. Many times my kid asks queries and it gives foolish answers. There are no good stories we can get to hear unless we pay for another subscription other than the prime. !!!. The definition it gives is mostly from wikiepedia which it thinks as source of truth.!!.Many times I felt throwing the device to the floor. In a nutshell , this is a dumb musical player created by Amazon SW team. There is no element of intelligence to it. They just integrated it with routines and we can do those routines and play the song (the one , that it decides) . Amazon product team ihasnt improved this device at all in the new generation model."
AR,1,India,23-05-2019,FALSE,2,"Overpriced alarm clock, and nothing else","Absolutely insensitive mic, have to scream my lungs out for it to hear. Barely any settings to change this sensitivity. Mic will not work when fan is on. Mic will also stop working when it is playing something.Most fuckall machine invented my mankind:Doesn't stop the routine when I ask it to.A dog might understand what I was asking.Can easily add more practical features, like battery or using echo as speakers via aux."
Rahul Gupta,5,India,07-04-2021,FALSE,0,Very good for listening music. Sound quality is nice and enough loud.,"When you do not want to exercise for searching music on phone, then just say about your desired song, it works very well. Sound is good and enough loud.Do not expect the AI or robotic thing in this device. We are far behind in area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I will take much much time for AI to be comparable to the brain of human being."
Shrenik,5,India,20-07-2019,FALSE,0,Your favorite Assistant for the house!,"Want an innocent smart assistant to help you with the silly tasks and make your life simpler?That's exactly when Alexa comes into the picture. Simple, straight to the point, getting your tasks done ranging from switching on the TV(with smart plugs), starting your favorite TV show right where you left it(from Fire TV), listening to your favorite ebook from the chapter which you heard last to telling you the India today news with the background noise which feels like the reporter is reporting directly from the place of the incident.It even sets the alarm for you and has 'cheering noises' to help you start your day with a crazy amount of energy. Adding things to your cart on Amazon, playing truth and dare, organizing GK and Bollywood quiz tournaments, you name it and it can do it. It doesn't have the wits(yet) and it won't make fun of you(consider yourself lucky it's not Siri) but gets pretty much everything done which a smart assistant should. Highly recommended to make your home smarter!"
Amazon Customer,4,India,28-11-2020,FALSE,0,Absolutely worthed!!,Sound - The clarity is fantastic. It does provide a surround sound feel. The bass is great until volume 7 after which it starts jarring. Please don't expect it to fulfill a theatre or disc like experience!Voice recognition - pretty much spot on everytime!!Only drawback is no bluetooth option for aux capabilities!!
Binosh,5,India,22-10-2019,FALSE,0,Now it is working!!,"Purchased Echo Dot (3ed Gen).connected ... but Alexa didn't respond very well.

Jayaraman,4,India,18-08-2020,FALSE,0,Echo Dot first impression,"Product seems to be good, speaker quality is not that great. Could have been better. When you hear nice songs it seems like a Mono, not a perfect stereo you can hear.Alexa integration is seamless, Alexa skill adding is the best I have seen. I have a Google Home and it used to disconnect a lot and this device is pretty decent and working fine so far.The additional advantage is Aux output so I can connect to my boom box so get the Alexa features with my speakers.The pairing of speakers, I don't know why I can't pair my other Bluetooth device with this? Why Amazon is not allowing this ..? Whether it will be considered in the future release?Alexa app seems to be better than Google Home App, where you have a very limited option and no one knows what kind of skills that google home has by default."
Sravani,2,India,23-06-2019,FALSE,0,Not so happy compared to google home,"Its not so good compared to google home’s speaker and also not happy with the input instructions. Even if i call aadhya, alexa turns on and it doesnt catch most of the words... lot of improvement is required with input words... sometimes it goes crazy... i say something and it plays something else... i submit feedback in alexa app wenever possible so that they can improve further"
NC,1,India,29-09-2020,FALSE,1,Unrelated but necessary to know about AMAZON'S after sale and warranty service. Be warned.,"This is the second time that I have had to purchase this product, my first echo dot device stopped working and since it was not in warranty I was advised by AMAZON to send it to their CTDI team which handles out of warranty devices. My experience with CTDI has been nothing short of a nightmare. The CTDI team is impossible to contact, they do not respond to emails and their phone service does not work. After having my device for nearly 5 months , I was sent a redicolous high estimate for repair which costs as much as a new device itself. Not only that , the email coatation is for a fire stick when I sent them an echo dot device. Again no clarification received from them till date even though I have sent a second reminder.My reason to go into such details is that one should never waste ones time with CTDI and what is even more shocking is AMAZON'S attitude once your device is out of warranty.AMAZON arrogantly washes their hands of you and your problem ."
John,5,India,09-09-2020,FALSE,0,Brilliant Product,"I got this one during the Prime day sale. I have used this for a month now and below is my review.Pros:1. Excellent Speaker - both as a standalone speaker and smart device (at the price point i got on Prime day)2. Alexa - Has almost no trouble in recognizing voice and very rarely does it falter, plus integration with Amazon ecosystem - You can place order, track deliveries and also receive news updates all via Eco dot.3. Bluetooth - Can even use this as a blue-tooth speaker for iPad / Phone . Does a great job (needs power source though)Cons:1. Portability : A removable USB cable on adapter would have enabled much wider usage (battery bank power?)2. One command at a time - It cannot execute 2 or 3 commands in one go - Like switch on the light, & play music will need you to say ""Alexa"" 2 times. Can be a bit abrupt at times - in starting and stopping music etc.Verdict : Brilliant smart speaker for home use at a great price point."
anc,5,India,20-11-2019,FALSE,0,Works best for my toddler,"Got it for 2,204.09 + 5% cashback along with free ""smart"" wipro light bulb. Wipro bulb is 1 star item but even considering it as free, got a good deal on echo dot.Sound quality is surprisingly good! Alexa is well integrated and Alexa does the job of playing songs for my toddler and parents quiet well. (This is what it is being used for 90% of the time). Alexa is not as smart as google, but for intended purpose, serves us well.Tried to pair with my firestick, could pair it easily but the fire stick uses this as output device by default, instead of tv speakers and there is noticeable lag between video on tv and sound through echo dot. Does not have option to stream audio through tv speakers and use echo dot just as remote for voice commands. So for now I have unpaired the firestick and the echo dot. Hopefully future updates may fix this. (Lag between video audio would be a very hard thing to fix, but there should be an option to use echo dot as just a voice remote)"
Shiv Jirwankar,5,India,18-10-2018,FALSE,4,A much needed upgrade to this amazing device from Amazon.,"This new echo dot 3rd generation is what I wanted. This smart speaker is capable to play a good music in a large size room. Alexa is smart and quick enough to react on your command. The muisc and the bass is very well balanced for a soothing music experience.Also, music streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Muisc and Saavn are also available to play music from. So, need to connect the device with your phone. Instead ask Alexa to play any music, playist or album of your choice.However Aexa mobile app can be improved but that is nothing much to do with the amazing performance of this very device. Go for it guys, you won't regret it."
akshat rami,1,India,24-10-2018,FALSE,8,Echo Dot was not responding,"This is the worst product that i have from amazon , beacuse some time it wasn't responding.

Rohit Verma,1,India,29-09-2019,FALSE,2,Good as a novelty for kids,"Horrible music sound. Only good for speeches or weather reports, not for music. Bluetooth connectivity is a pain if you have multiple devices. Stationary use only (no battery). If you go and plug in another room, for example from living room to bedroom you have to start connectivity again from scratch. Alexa software is ages behind Google voice. I am returning this product. Good for a novelty, although you can get better items to show off for that price. Could not even recognize Gurgaon. Don’t be fooled by 3rd generation... just some more fancy lights. If the price drops after you buy it and take it somewhere else. You are basically left with price difference hanging around your neck! Rip off. Great for kids though!"
Amazon Customer,5,India,13-02-2021,FALSE,1,Excellent  for Kids,"Likes: Awesome Voice Recognition and friendly too it works with my mobile Hotspot, no need of wifi router.

chandumandava39,1,India,29-01-2020,FALSE,2,Creator of the speaker is smarter but not alexa,"Amazon alexa in India has limited skills. Spotify is one of those skill that is not available in India.Worst part of Alexa is music playlist cannot be created in any skill that is available. Prime music playlist can be played but, both alexa and prime music account should be same.This is monopoly business.Example: what if you have gifted to your friends. They also should have prime account on their name.Think before you buy.I suggest go for Google smart speaker."
Er. Shammi kumar,4,India,04-02-2019,FALSE,2,$$$ Small but Bombastic sound. value for money,"The media could not be loaded.  $$$ Awesome Bluetooth Speaker with AI.Value for money ,got it during sale of Rs2999/-. Playing songs via JioSavan and Gaana app and sound that comes out from this Small echo dot 3rd Gen 🔊 was Bombastic for a small room , but playing songs through Mobile via Bluetooth is not giving that much of clear sound of songs some sort of Treble sound is missing but awesome with Gaan app and Jiosaavan app. Regarding Amazon Alexa AI sometimes not triggered I have to say 2X or 3X Alexa then Alexa respond to our voice , I think Amazon have to continue to Use concept of 7 microphones instead of 4 microphone which was in Echo dot 2nd Generation. Negative part of this Echo dot 3rd is it has circular plugin port to echo dot which should be usb 2.0 which 2nd Gen echo dot have plus point here. I think Amazon should change this Power Plugin port to normal USB 2.0 so that we can connect our Smartphone charger cables to it and connect it to any Power bank. One Con is that anyone who knows how to trigger Alexa in your absence your neighbours and their children's can operate Alexa to play something or if you have smart plugs connected to Alex a theybeasily can turn On and turn Off lights."
Jathin,4,India,28-08-2019,FALSE,0,its more of a gimmik,"These things are supposed to make your life easier, but I do not think it has in anyways, for example, when the power goes and come back all the smart light in your home will be automatically on. or some times it does not recognize your command. or you have to shout at it to wake it at times. or you have to keep the wifi on all the time. so and so. It's a nice parlor trick when your friends visit. in its current iteration, it's just a tec show off nothing more."
NUSRAT LALANI,4,India,25-09-2020,FALSE,0,Good product,The new improved Alexa has better sound quality. Bought it with one plus 43 inch tv.But like other electronics it should come with installation as few features are little difficult to understand and the guys who came to install the tv said they didn't know anything abt Alexa. Everytime u either have to Google or call amazon team
Ranjit Mishra,2,India,04-09-2019,FALSE,2,Its not battery operated,"Looks very nice. Sound quality is good for the size of it. But the major drawback is that it needs to be connected to power source, hence you can't use it anywhere. This should be rechargeable battery powered, otherwise its not on much use if you can't place it wherever you want. Say partying with friends in the patio with no power outlet - Echo Dot can'e be used, hence its not of much use."
Som Limbu,5,India,12-06-2020,FALSE,0,Great for Kids!,"My Nephew is in love with it. At first he was surprised how it could answer all his never ending questions. Now he is so attached with it and guess what we are also relieved now, we don't get so bugged by his all sorts of questions now. Some we knew some we had to research. Now he can himself find out his answers and use it as a PDA for himself.Update:I ordered second one for my another nephew's bday. Its great product to introduce technology to the kids."
Anamika K.,5,India,11-11-2019,FALSE,0,Very useful & a great  product,Echo dot has a good sound quality. I can hear it from the hall while sitting in my room. It recognises the voice commands really well. No problem in that. I feel a little better integration with products like Savan is required. Alexa cannot find my personal playlist on savan even after linking my Savan account with alexa. Other than that i feel it’s a good product to have.
Abhi,5,India,25-01-2019,FALSE,0,Must buy,"There are some things which you should really buy and echo products are one of them. I have been using echo dot since last 3 months. Setup is easy using the Alexa app. There are many skills (news reading, streaming music etc) that you can set-up. Also, you can add skills such as nursery rhymes, Amar Chitra Katha for kids through the app.Occasionally, Amazon sends feedback links, wherein you can share your experience to tune the product further."
Kajal,1,India,05-06-2019,FALSE,3,Deaf Alexa makes you scream to the top of Ur voice.,"Horrible device... The 2nd gen was 100 times better.. this Alexa does not hear at all if the vol is high or you are in another corner of the room. When music is played at vol 7, you need to keep it near your mouth and scream STOP Alexa... for it to listen. The support from Amazon support staff was ZERO.I had initially purchased black colour, as it wasn't hearing properly.. asked for a replacement ( did not intend to return as had brought it during the Great Indian sale) . But the staff asked me to return it (as according to them, they were afraid that a refurbished piece would be sent against a new one) and re purchase it. They assured me the price protection n issued me Amazon credit for the change in price.But the biggest mistake I did was brought it again at the request of my lo. Same problem Alexa does not hear at all. Automatically telling the cricket scores. Have again put for replacement.. this time I requested the team to give me the credit in Amazon pay to go in for the Amazon echo or echo plus instead of the dot.. but they did not agree...Now not sure of what I will be getting back."
KRISHNA,3,India,09-01-2021,FALSE,0,Pros and cons,Pros1. It explains Vocabulary2. for English and Hindi Songs ( that only specific to jio saavan or amazon music ) Cons1. It cannot recognize voice with low volume from a distance more than a 1.5 m2. It cannot Understand and Play many Telugu songs. It only suggests songs which are available on the music app which you have kept default or amazon music.3.Bluetooth connection with the device very difficult to set up if you have not used it for a while4. Changing a Wifi Network takes a lot of time. Every time u need to enter set up mode ( Orange Color light with pressing dot button ). It is better if we can directly change from app.
Arijit Adak,2,India,19-09-2020,FALSE,0,Good but needs lots of improvements to match google assistant or Siri,"When I first brought this product I loved this but after 2 months of use I had to reset it as it could not connect to internet and to set-up for 2nd time it took me 2 hours as really could not connect to internet.The main problem for this device is, if there is no internet then its a dumb box, could not do anything. This is nowhere mentioned in the product description. Also if you have multiple internet connection, it cannot save 2 or more internet connections which could be connected when one is not working and this is my main disappointment. I would not comment on sound quality as there are much more products at this price range which has greater sound quality.Speech recognition is very good, but most of the times it interprets wrong for which song I need. This is irritating most of the times and then I switch to mobile app to play the right song, so having alexa and having a normal bluetooth speaker for me is same, no value addition. Hoping Amazon will improve its AI features a lot like google or Siri."
nikhil sachan,5,India,21-12-2020,FALSE,0,A perfect companion,"I love my echo dot device. There some things, which are really good like whisper command. I am using google mini for last 1 year, it is also really good but some diff are really noteworthy. I am living in hostel so I don’t want to disturb my neighbour student in night when I command my echo ,which is far from my bed to switch off my light. In google I have to shout (not loud but still enough) in echo I can just whisper, and it responds every single time. The second thing is during switching off or switching on the light , google repeat the full name of my light for example it shouts ” switching on Nikhil Syska bulb” during night if you have forgotten to lower the volume suddenly you will call google “ switch of the light “ it will shout back “ switching off Nikhil Syska bulb “ but echo dot just say “ok” which way more convenient.Though when it comes to connecting to laptop automatically the scenario is totally opposite , google connects silently just making a ping sound and echo repeats my lappy name.The other thing is buttons in place of touch . I like buttons in place of touch , which make its tough to pick the google , most of the time either it play/ pause the songs or increase / decrease the volume . If I have voice assistance, why would I need touch 🙄.Alexa integration- because I use amazon shoping and I have kindle , the integration is very much useful for me . My echo reads my book for me . It remind me if my order is coming today.Portability - it’s shape makes it less beautiful but good in portability. It fits in my bag so conveniently just ignore the dangling cable."
abhiman,3,India,25-09-2020,FALSE,0,"Works wonderfully, Stupidly priced","The media could not be loaded.  Works beautifully, have bought 3 to link the entire house. Frequently group and play them together, use drop in to create an intercom, and have linked to speakers, bulbs, TV and other gadgets. I would still give this only 3 stars because it is double the rate here in India compared to the US. A country with 25 TIMES India's per capita income. What is this pricing Amazon? I understand there may be taxes in India but still. 2X the price ?This not withstanding will buy a larger Echo speaker whenever there is a sale on Echo with reasonable prices."
Vißin Thomas,1,India,25-11-2021,FALSE,0,Do not By Any Amazon product,Its a absolutely cheating for the customer. If we buy any amazon product . Definitely we want to buy amazon prime members also. In this case if any song want to play absolutely need amazon prime membership otherwise we cannot play music through any other app. No Google Apps are not working through amazon alexa. If anybody want to amazon Alexa . Go For GOOGLE HOME. Its have everything. And also free cost for all App
MR.DIBYA MITRA,5,India,17-09-2020,FALSE,0,Alexa require some improvement and need to speed up to Google Assistance,"Nice one I am enjoying but the voice recognition still required to be improved by Amazon as some time it recognises u but and some time it doesn't. But some where I felt still Alexa required to improve than Google Assistance, as Google is much faster and much informative then Alexa, as many times it says sorry I don't know this."
Subhamoy,4,India,27-12-2019,FALSE,1,Impressed,"Pros:Awesome intelligent speaker.Sound quality is impressive. Interacts with your commands unbelievably.You can listen to All India Radio,online FM channels(e.g Radio Mirchi etc),unlimited songs from saavan and Amazon prime music (you need subscription for both of it).Host of other services are waiting for your command -""Alexa..."".Con: It doesn't have a battery so you can not use it wherever you want.It should be plugged into a power source to operate.It's best for indoor use.It needs subscription for some of its music streaming services.Suggestion: Please add Audible Suno support in it.Overall it is a really great product."
Obed Ernest,5,India,09-03-2019,FALSE,0,An edutainment device,The Echo Dot is a sleek and a very useful add-on in my home. I use it for listening to music news. My kids use it for fun facts games and listening to songs. Setting alarms and reminders is very useful. You can set Alexa to perform certain tasks in an order. I Use Alexa is smart home capability to control the lights. Overall A useful device packed with many features .
Gaurav Kumar,1,India,08-10-2021,FALSE,3,WRONG INFORMATION about Echo Dot,"I ordered this product because it shows in web description as ""Echo Dot (3rd Gen)"".But when I connected to it with my alexa app, it shows Echo Dot ""2nd Gen"" instead of ""3rd Gen"".I am feeling like cheated."
Abhishek,4,India,27-06-2020,FALSE,1,power package !!!!,this is a good product i chose it over google mini nest because it was cheaper and it contains a auxiliary port as well for output . Sound quality is good unless you have a very big room then you might want to connect external speakers. spotify works just fine . Not able to integrate saavn as of now . Some songs it cannot find and you ought to say the movie name or something like that for it to recognize.Apart from that it controls my light well. Very good buy i liked it enough !!!!.
Anooja George,5,India,18-10-2019,FALSE,0,Amazon Echo Dot... a good product,"The Amazon Echo Dot... a good product... able to understand most of the voice commands... the sound quality is good...Bought it during the Amazon sale...Was actually looking for a blue tooth speaker, when the sale came up...and saw the Dot on sale..paid 1999/- for it... Working fine so far... The only con is, works only when plugged into a power outlet and there is no battery backup..."
Vinod K P,5,India,20-07-2019,FALSE,0,Excellent product with all rounder performance.,Excellent all rounder. Good quality. Should include access to youtube.com as soon as possible otherwise will miss a large new customers group. Emphasis should be given to all Indian languages songs especially Malayalam and Tamil. As of now not recognizing particular Malayalam songs or genres. Please make alternative arrangements to using in car by making an extra adaptor compatible for car.
Rajdeep,5,India,25-02-2020,FALSE,0,A very handy tool in a busy life.,"A must have product in your room. It does understand English and Hindi questions and queries better than 'Google Home' and also the sound quality is excellent when compared. Bluetooth feature comes very handy and notification light-blinking is also a great way. Better build quality than the previous generations. Featured skills are also available on the Alexa app including the Alexa-calling and broadcasting features. Mic is also very responsive too. Bass of the speaker is sufficient for a medium-sized room. Only issue is that with the manual buttons on the top which ""for my taste"" looks very ugly. Although if looks are not the priority then it is THE BEST buy in the smart-speaker segment today."
John wick,1,India,09-05-2019,FALSE,3,Must read before buy,The worst software.no gaana no Saavn no hungama no Spotify..it's technically there but always shows some error code and Alexa don't even know what gaana and Saavn is and they can't be found on Alexa skills.go for Google home mini..Alexa has really poor info about any countries other than us/canada.most of the time she says I don't know that.as of now the only way to play music is to purchase Amazon prime music or Apple music or play from Bluetooth on your phone.I hate the app personally it's really slow and irritating.
Ravi,5,India,03-10-2019,FALSE,2,Exceptional device for smart home,This is my second alexa device. This is one of the best device for smart home for such a affordable price as 2000 Rs along with wipro smart light. Must buy. No cons except a few more advancements in the software which can be addressed in future.
Manna,5,India,06-10-2019,FALSE,2,Better than any bluetooth speaker out there in the 5k range,A much better alternative to a Bluetooth speaker. You get much more than what you pay for.

Gaurav Bansal,3,India,31-03-2019,FALSE,1,Best in class but there are still many issues,"Its a superb product by Amazon. Although it is overpriced product in my view just because basically for music, news etc. We are spending 4.5 K that really not worth as true price for that product would be 2.5 K considering it's good speakers, echo , bass etc. Its good innovation but it is on developing phase because of following:-1. As many a times Alexa find difficulties to understand our language2. Not many options available for exploring in music only ganna and savaan is available.3. The Amazon Alexa app is the worst, as in case Alexa didn't get the song you are willing to listen, so you can't search that particular song on app4. There is no voice locking system as anybody can change the music by giving command5. Works well with WiFi only .6. You have to connect all time with power plug. No other option. So if lights have gone then it's of no use. Biggest disadvantage I guess because we light shortage is biggest problem n we listen to music/news etc. Only when there is no lights ."
Ram,3,India,30-08-2020,FALSE,0,Voice recognition is not good,I was writing this review after three weeks of usage. I like sound quality in this echo device and very portable device.I dislike voice recognition is not good and whenever I turn on this device for first time it's not connecting to internet need to reset or start it again which makes us irritating everytime.Alexa has integrated to more things but some of the integration not working well.My rating for this product will be 2.5/5
narsingh acharya,4,India,02-08-2019,FALSE,0,Echo Dot (3rd Gen)-Review,"Sound quality is good but maybe improved to better.Blue tooth connectivity takes longer time and some times unassailable.2)While changing Wi-Fi connection it requires once again settings like press dot and look for yellow ring and so on...This may be simplified.3)The above is required because in India strength of Wi-Fi varies from place to place.Even changing of room also have the effects on streaming strength.4)Though it has certain shortcomings,still is good for music lovers and other utilities which are to be explored .I love this and hope it can still be made better."
Pratiksha,5,India,26-10-2021,FALSE,1,Wonderful,It was a great deal at that price.. the smart bulb and echo dot pair perfectly and works fine and all other smart devices are easily recognised by Alexa app and there was no hassle in connecting devices and using echo dot. The combo is great.

And to be honest, it is an amazing device which makes ur life easy!!!Though ""Google Home"" gives satisfactory answers than ""Echo Dot"" for the questions which are asked, but the Sound Quality that ""Echo Dot"" offers is just AMAZING...If u are confused about which one to buy, i.e, ""Google Home Mini"" or ""Echo Dot"", then I would suggest for Echo dot because of its overall performance...And coming to the Smart Bulb, I would say that, it is kinda a good product which u can get at a low price..."
 Dinesh,5,India,23-06-2021,FALSE,0,the best,"this is a review after six months of usageit's one of the best smart speakers out thereI've also used google home which has its own cons but on a daily usage basis this the best sound quality is outstanding compared to the older gens and google music services integration is also good but comes with a con you won't get access to prime music content unless you're a Prime customer which earlier wasn't the case, everyone, no matter you're a prime member or not you get to access the amazon music which now is quite annoying voice recognition works flawlesslyoverall am satisfied with this purchase"

Amit Yadav,2,India,11-10-2019,FALSE,0,Echo dot3 - An Average Smart speaker.,"The sound quality is very good as compared to previous generation . But Alexa assistants skills and integration with other smart devices(bluetooth) including Fire TV is very choppy.Alexa response is incorrect at times even after multiple repeats. It's wifi reception is not good, cannot work in weak internet reception , Google home mini performs pretty well on these parameters."
Sijo Varghese,5,India,28-11-2020,FALSE,0,Amazon's Alexa is Amazing,So voice recognition is difficult when we play a song at a high volume. Maybe the mic couldn't recognize our commands when the speakers are working at high volume. There's no inbuilt battery for the device and I believe that's good as it would never face battery issues. You can use it whenever you want it and no need to worry about charging to keep the battery active.SHE IS JUST AWESOME and Active the way she replies...

Rashi,3,India,22-11-2019,FALSE,0,Sound quality can be improved more and clear listening by Alexa what is asked .,"Sound quality should be more high .Many unnecessary bugs and errors comes by Alexa .Some pop ups are very irritating .Once settings and a good connection is there then only Alexa commands strongly works .I just love the alarm section command and songs , Wipro light in/off command specially .In this much cost and special discount offer it's worth to buy though and give it a try ."
Amazon Customer,5,India,01-11-2019,FALSE,0,Google home mini is jealous of you,I told to my google mini home. I like Alexa more than you. Now she is jealous. Can recognize all my family members voice. Includes my daughters. But lack of knowledge when compare with google home mini. Also cannot play old Telugu songs. As amazon don't have wide collection of Telugu songs.Voice recognition at its best when compare with home mini. Sound and bass also good. Value plus for what I spend.

Ankit,1,India,16-02-2022,FALSE,0,Bad product,It worked good for about a month. But after that it started hanging. Now most of the times it doesn't recognise my words and many times it gets hanged while playing music. Wipro bulb camed with it also has the same situation. I keep its switch on but Alexa says that bulb is offline. Total waste of money.
Neha Mangla,4,India,23-05-2019,FALSE,0,Very nice product,This product is nice sound quality is amazing but the main problem is that it's quite difficult to setup echo dot and to connect it with phone and Bluetooth doesnot show echo dot's name so that we can connect it. But when it's connected it's amazing to operate it. Sometimes it is quite difficult for the echo dot to understand our voice . We say something else and it understand something else.
MAYUR MADAN JAMGAONKAR,1,India,18-09-2020,FALSE,1,Dumbest device I have ever seen in my life ..,"I have never seen such a dumb device in my life. I remember the small piano or such devices our parents used to give us when we were 6 years old. Whatever you ask it has only few stereotype answers. Playing a desired song is the most irritating part. It never knows what you want to play, instead it plays some fixed song list no matter what you asked her play. Also it also doesn't have songs with filters such as genere, mood etc. My opinion ? DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.. your mobile is far useful to do things you expect Alexa can ..."
Muhsin,5,India,26-11-2021,FALSE,1,It's totally worth it.,"I bought it for 3500 for 2 echo dots and 1 bulb. For this price its totally worth it. I really enjoyed using it and my sis has a toddler who is easily pacified using alexa light controls and songs (we have bought costlier toys but it's alexa who mostly saves the day). So for my home, It already did more than I paid for.😌😌😌"
Saquib,4,India,04-09-2020,FALSE,0,"Alexa, I love you ☺️","A must product for every one as this is a good source for quick information, and music play. The only improvement that is required is chargeable option as it requires direct power supply to function all the time. This particular one does not have clock display. You have to search for echo dot with clock in amazon. And it might cost you 1000 more. But anyways it can tell you current time .Hence giving 4/5, but still a very nice product to work with."
adarsha joisa,1,India,22-07-2019,FALSE,2,Doesn't understand english,"90% of the time, I ask alexa to do something, and it does something else entirely. It was a minor irritation at first, but now I'm questioning why I even bought this stupid device. It doesn't even understand you unless you speak in an unrealistically ridiculous Indian accent. Life would've been a lot more peaceful if I hadn't bought this device."
manish punia,3,India,19-03-2021,FALSE,0,Stop bluetooth announcement,"The most frustrating feature of Alexa is the annoying announcement while connecting to Bluetooth. it does every time when it connects with the device and there is no way to disable it. People have been crying for years, while Amazon is not listening.Other than that it is much better in comparison to google home mini. In comparison voice quality and search too."
Dr rinkee ,4,India,19-10-2019,FALSE,0,It's good but needs a better software update,Look it's good but there are still many questions which echo cannot answer something which Google home does very easily but overall it's good. I can be improved if echo's software is updated.there is one more problem that it sometimes it does not catch your voice while it is answering your question so you will have to press the button at that time to stop echo from answering. But one thing I would like to say that its speaker is really good one.
Nilesh,1,India,06-06-2021,FALSE,1,FRAUD BY AMAZON!,"Got the product and it was working great for a few months! Then the power adaptor stopped working! Amazon Executive told me check it and reply to them, so I did say power adaptor is broken, just fix that. They issue a replacement, the driver doesnt take the product due to its too old. I tell customer care and they are like its fine, the next time they will take it. This happened 4 times and none of them took it and each customer care says it will be fine.GOING TO COURT IS EASIER THAN GETTING THIS DEVICE FIXED!!!!"

lalit rajpurohit,4,India,19-01-2019,FALSE,1,Awesome built with decent sound.,The amazon echo dot 3rd generation is far more better than its old lines. If you are looking for a smart speaker at budget price then go for it. It sounds even little better than Google home mini.Pros:-1. Better improved Sound quality with decent bass.2. Built is also better and doesn't feel cheap.Cons:-1. Even though its better in terms of sound quality but it is still required to pay attention on better software.2. A big gap in terms of software between google assistant and Alexa.
sachin,5,India,20-11-2019,FALSE,0,Good product with scope of improved comparability,"Perfect product if u wish to remain handsoff. Only issue is non compliance with YouTube. Wish it could have been compatable with versatile music players like YouTube. As of now it's connected to savaan and wink( I am not sure). Another issue which I came across is, to be coupled with the Amazon based platforms again u have to be a prime member. Anyway it's a good product."

Then i complained, amazon provided me an exchange buy again an opened box/ seal was broken. This time i came down & kept it. Because i don't have patience to do exchange again & again. I think in the sale when price is low, amazon will provide only refurbished product."

Rupen Ghosh,1,India,15-09-2020,FALSE,1,Disappointed with Amazon for d first time,"I had purchased one in Feb 2020.Ot stopped working in 6 months, so I ordered replacement. And guess what I have two replacements in 1 week and audio quality is VERY POOR and volume has issues. Also music syncing is not happening at times. Earlier one was good, but malfunctioned so had to get replaced. The replacement is even worst, sound comes very very low. Pathetic service from Dealer who is selling this ECO!!!!!!!!!!"
Sam,1,India,15-09-2020,FALSE,1,Stopped working in eight months -- Amazon not replacing,"Bought in Republic day sale -- Jan 2020. Stopped working in early Sept.Asked for replacement. Customer support said that the power cord might have become faulty (without checking).As per me device might be faulty.they cannot replace as power cord not in stock. Any ETA -- no ETA. It might even take a month.Worst service if the thing is in warranty. After one year, you can buy new which would be hassle free"
Vishal Shekar,3,India,18-10-2020,FALSE,1,Can't answer simple questions that Google can....,"The reason for 3 start review is, it can't answer simple questions that Google can answer.

Was happy with home automation commands....But felt absolutely disappointed with the answers."

The speaker has a very rich sound quality.. it's loud too!( Extremely happy with it)... and Alexa responds to the slightest bit of voice... You can call it from the hall even if it is in your bedroom! It actually even stops to Listen to you when you're having a conversation with the word ""Alexa""... (Very good Alexa integration)Here's my crazy story: I loved echo dot so much that I thought I'd immediately upgrade to echo show.. I returned this and got that . The Alexa integration on show.. is.. nothing compared to dot..it was extremely disappointing 😂. So, I returned show to buy echo dot again.. and.. the offer period was over by then! 😂😂😂Waiting for the next offer to get echo dot third generation."
Shekhar,5,India,15-03-2021,FALSE,0,Buy it with confidence,"Echo dot is a wonderful piece of equipment and luckily got it on a heavily discounted price of 2999. I read a lot of reviews and even negative reviews , lot of comparisons with google mini etc. I don't understand if there is a delivery related issue why to give a negative review for product. I already had a battery based portable JBL charge blue tooth speaker. This was something new for me. Based on usage for last two days- Sound quality is good enough to fill a room of 15x12 feet size. you will enjoy it.- Accepted voice command with perfection never missed. (even when music is playing on high)- Finish quality of product is superb.- For trials paid my gas bills effortlessly.- I am not into smart LED's but plan to try them also- Three exciting colors to choose from, I took the purple one.- Was easily paired with mobile to be used as a blue tooth speaker.- Thousands of skills are there to be explored and used.I will recommend this product definitely in today's scene where people are into work from home kind of setup."

They seem to be having more fun 😁😁.The voice quality is pretty decent for it size, and is adequate to pleasurable listening . Amazon prime membership takes the experience a notch higher with access to Amazon Play Music Library, which I must say is quite well equiped. Plus it has various playlist for varying Moods.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. It surely comes in handy"
Chandru,5,India,29-12-2021,FALSE,0,Awesome product,"My son has been asking for a long time. However we weren't buying. This time, we decided to buy. It's an awesome product. we are astonished by its voice recognition capabilty. It's picks up right songs with minimal inputs.We have integrated it with fire stick also.No regrets...I recommend a buy ...Happy Alexaing :)"
Vidyadhar Misal,3,India,21-10-2021,FALSE,0,Few improvements needed,"They need to provide battery backup so that we can carry it anywhere.It needs to play songs randomly also like YouTube, instead of asking it to play. It might have this feature and I may be unaware so second comment can be ignored if it has it.I returned it as I wanted to play songs in my bathroom where there is no electric connection."
chaitanya,5,India,20-01-2021,FALSE,0,Using it since 2 plus years. Simple and awesome,"The media could not be loaded.  I have been using it since years.Perfect home smart speaker. Sounds crisp and listens carefullyPair a couple of them and get the awesome stereo effect as well .Can be a smart speaker in kitchen , working desk stereo , bed side night audio device. You name it it delivers.Loved this product through out the usage"
Pritam,2,India,25-12-2021,FALSE,0,Output via 3.5mm jack is very poor,"I just don't want to integrate it with anything in my house as it doesn't sound clear via built in speaker and 3.5mm output jack, I brought it for listening music, podcast and GK but due to poor audio clarity it is still not in plugged in state in my home, it is just sitting on table without it's adapter plugged in."
Shiban K Kak,5,India,20-11-2021,FALSE,0,An intelligent gadget.,"If you love to get help online and use that information to help plan your day then Alexa is the gadget for you from waking up with a beautiful tune to organizing your travel, grocery orders and keeping track of all your calendar you have just to command and the gene will do it. The beauty is it can understand Hindi commands as well and so even your Hinglish is accepted."
Aniket Waghmode,4,India,10-10-2019,FALSE,0,Satisfied and Happy.,"Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is the best in terms of hardware. Amazing sound quality with proper balance between base, mids and treble. And yes you can configure too in the Alexa app if you’d like.Next, is the build quality. It is really good and feels firm. Bluetooth and wi-fi connectivity is awesome. Best part is I can connect it to my phone & laptop and use it as an external speaker.The only downside for me is Alexa. She needs a lot of improvement in terms of knowledge. Basic things are carried out pretty well like reminders, alarms, music, etc. however, when it comes to answering questions she fails most of the time.Tip: Keep adding skills in the Alexa app for improvement."
Abhishek Jain,2,India,09-10-2021,FALSE,1,Poor Sound Recognition,"Not sure if it is my device or a general issue but the speech recognition is not up to the mark. The device doesnt respond to my device's ""Wake up"" text and I need to shout at the top of my voice to make it react. Not cool."
SVM,5,India,15-10-2021,FALSE,0,Wow What A Purchase !,The media could not be loaded.  Excellent Device I already unboxed and posted review in SVM Cars & Bikes YouTube channel .Purchased this with wipro smart bulb it's good for listening music and for kids to entertain and to gain knowledge .Best device with good voice recognition Must have device .

This isnt setup its like open setup and you might have a chance to set up the device successfully! Hurry! It really is so bad i am connected to amazon wcp network for hours Nothing happens, alexa just goes out of setup mode thats it. I cant do sheet. Tooooo bad and tiring and waste of time."

Kunal Srivastava,5,India,17-08-2019,FALSE,0,Good product for entertainment and commanding smart lights,"Good product for entertainment... but there are many cons - for e.g. sound is okay but bass is not up to the mark.Alexa didnt support Hindi language and few of the English commands too. The best feature i like it, to give commands to my smart lights. overall its just for enjoying or playing music"
RGS Sundar ,5,India,28-05-2019,FALSE,0,Fantastic,"Latest review. Using for the last one yearExcellent. Fully satisfied. Solid performance and value for money. Built quality is very nice and far ahead of hey google----------------After using for about 6 months, My opinion about Alexa is fantastic and quite useful.Now I am two wifi smart bulbs and Alexa is good at receiving instructions.If we ask for specific song we have to be more precise in asking otherwise we have to repeat the processWhile reading from audible it is becoming difficult to instruct to go to particular Page. Some pages we may read and some through audibleI love Alexa. Hundreds of skills can be utilised. Go for it with out any second thoughtReview at the time purchase----------------------------------Fantastic. Able to understand commands. But on the day of installation we found a bit difficult. But as we got used to it ,now we are feeling more comfortable.Suggestions.. Still Alexa has to improve in general knowledge section. Alexa is staring immediately after the wake up word Alexa.. It has to wait for the last word of the command.Example.. If I ask to say about Hrithik Roshan, Instead of saying about Hrithik Roshan it starts playing Hrithik Roshan songs. Even news section also , previously read news paper only it is reading again.But once got used to it ,then it is amazing experience. Go for it right now. Sound quality is awesome. Play with it continuously, then you will come to know how to make use of Alexa."
keshav kumar,5,India,29-10-2019,FALSE,0,Amazing Alexa! Simply superb👌👌👌👌,"Eco dot 3rd generation is amazing device, somtimes beyond my imagination ... Alexa is complete package of entertainment - it has Radio channels like vividh bharti, fm gold,fm rainbow etc. and unlimited old and latest songs @amazon music and other sources like hungama music, jokes and much more .... It can read my Kindle books as audio book...Eco dot also has powerful speaker so it's rocking device. Thanks Amazon for Alexa. Recommended!👍👍👍👍"
Pradeep Esteves,5,India,10-09-2020,FALSE,0,Excellent as expected,"Is there a need for a review? Echo Dot is smooth in its functioning, did not have to train our voice etc it did it auto for all in family. Integrating with the smart bulb was so smooth. It is worth the money, especially if you want to enjoy music and connect up smart devices in your home."
Nayak,3,India,25-10-2020,FALSE,1,just an expensive speaker nothing else.,"The media could not be loaded.  i like the product.its sound quality is awesome but can not recognize my voice properly.i have to speak multiple time. if you want a speaker go for it,don't expect anything else.i think it will going to improve in future but for now its only a expensive speaker. ita a made in china product.i returned it to the seller"
Sachin,4,India,01-06-2020,FALSE,3,Good but China made,Good product but..Made in China.. And sometimes messes up with voice recognition..5 star if they make it in India... Especially not China
Puru,1,India,21-10-2020,FALSE,1,"Distorted bass/sound. Defected product received in Imphal,Manipur.","This is my second purchase, the first one was bought in Noida. It was great. But this one, I got it delivered in Imphal, Manipur. The bass of the speaker is distorted, the sound is distorted. It is nowhere as good as the one I got it in Noida. Is Amazon trying to sell defected products in the north-east or something? It takes longer than usual to reach Imphal even tho I have a prime membership, on top of that, you're selling us defected products. Shameful. Now I'll have to wait for 10-15 days for it to get replaced. With the lockdown and all, who knows how longer it'll take. Extremely disappointed."
vikash kadian,1,India,23-12-2018,FALSE,3,Only sound quality is good...otherwise nothing is good,1. Every time you need a charger with it...because no battery is provided2. It has a special charger. Charger pin is round type3. You can't use a common charger for it.4. Why usb charging pin or port not provided5. Two mobile phones are needed to use it6. A special Alexa app is needed to use it7. You can't play direct songs with it by connecting Bluetooth and wifi8. It is not portable every time need chargingSound is almost good but i suggest not to buy it.
Rajnish chaudhry,2,India,18-10-2019,FALSE,0,My review has been deleted that's why i am posting it again!!,"This might be helpful for you all. So my request is for technical team about this product please do not delete my review.It has got really bad software. Most of the answers of this alexa would be ""sorry i don't know that one"" , ""i am not sure"" which is very annoying & you will get to know this by the time.. google is much much better than alexa. Google is google knows every answers of your question. Alexa is not that good its good for like tuning light on or off, other than that you'r taking it for knowlegde purpose its not good. Even alexa dont know many of the hit bolleywood song if command it by saying name of the song or artist. I think google is doing better job than alexa. It has really bad software trust me."
Talha,5,India,10-09-2019,FALSE,0,Alexa Rocks 🤘,The media could not be loaded.  I bought it out of curiosity and I must say it's fun and the sound quality is better than what I was expecting. I am not able to utilise it completely because I don't have many smart items to integrate with right now but it's working perfectly with the Syska smart light which I got in the deal. There is still a lot of space in Making it's AI better. I'm hoping that it can connect with other sites and databases in future to provide more information and to answer query more accurately.
Unbiased Reviewer,4,India,21-01-2019,FALSE,1,Powerful AI speaker.,"This is indeed an improvement over the 2nd gen. But, a lot needs to be done in the machine learning part. 8 out of 10 ttimes, it understands but not as good as Google Home. I saw one of the reviewers on here bashing other reviewers saying that most of them don't know about sound quality in speakers. I don't agree with that. I agree with others who say this has a good quality of bass. For the price, you get an AI powered speaker with powerful sound. Go for it. This purchase will not be regretted."
RAGHU,2,India,06-12-2021,FALSE,0,Cheated and worst pick up service,"I got a faulty product. The lights were on for 5 mins..then all went off..there was no orange light...totally dissatisfied in 30 mins....Return Status: I applied for return on the same day that the product was delivered. The next day, i got a sms stating pick time was scheduled between 7 am to 7 pm which was ridiculous. Would the Amazon pickup service want someone to be in home for the whole day, just for receiving the pick up guy? I waited till 3pm and left for other imp service. Had an sms sent at the morning hrs about the approx pickup time, it would have been more meaningful. Totally, cheating and lethargic."
Bala Subrahmanyam,5,India,19-11-2021,FALSE,0,"It just a ""Ribo-for-Music"" "" Jai Patalabhairavi","Very useful one, Luckily no Ads disturbs the Stotralu,Mantralu,Songs so can enjoy uninterruptedly.

A N Sri Harish,4,India,05-04-2021,FALSE,0,Best to buy Alexa in this generation- A must have product in home.,"The media could not be loaded.  Best product I seen online and most useful now-a-days. It's useful for reminders, alarms and Morning suprabhatham playing automatically. Its voice is so clear. Light weight and neat finishing. Four microphones is best feature of this product. Have maximum access to songs and rhymes and information."
Amazon Customer,4,India,20-08-2019,FALSE,0,Product requires improvisation on many aspects,"Responds after repeated commands on most occassions. Doesn't play music through Amazon music inspite of repeated attempts even after configuring skills and making it a default app for music play. It's unresponsive on several occasions and really frustrates. Several skills are not functioning due to non availability for our country. Needs system updates from time to time to improve quality so as to make it a more useful product instead of just another speaker for listening just music. However, it's a gr8 experience to interact through voice commands which includes chatting as well when you are alone and missed a companion."
Madhu ks,5,India,24-08-2019,FALSE,0,U never repent,Great product and a must buy one..The main reason why its that good is it can be used as a independent device for music listening..it got plethora of hindi old and new songs integrated to it..also nice collection regional language songs.Second reason you can talk to alexa in simple english of ur own..even my son who is in 1st std talk to alexa and she listens and reacts well..Third reason the sound output is mediocre but the thing is provided a spot for connecting third party speakers..of any kind..So go for it u never repent
Brahmaji K,3,India,21-09-2020,FALSE,1,Not good for zoom calls,"I have purchased this for my kids class, but it always drops the voice in between and speaker is not compatible with zoom. We expect at least voice in the zoom call should be fine, but it isn't. it is not the internet or bandwidth problem, because I have 100Mbps and 5G WiFi connectivity. If you are going for meetings I would recommend to go with another product."
Amaljith,3,India,26-01-2022,FALSE,0,Not upto the mark,"While comparing with google assistant, the AI is far better in google assistant and the command pickup capabilities and other execution patterns are good in google assistant. But the voice bass and loudness is good in alexa. The lighting illumination and looks are impressive in alexa. But job wise Google assistant nailed the industry withe google's own AI features."
Christopher F.,5,India,15-06-2019,FALSE,0,One of the best smart gadgets I have,"Echo dot is one of the best gadgets in the market as it seems to be based on artificial intelligence that keeps evolving and understanding commands and requirements on a regular basis. Feels nice to command and get responses to small tasks like playing music, operating smart bulb, setting alarms and questions answered. The speaker has decent volume, crisp, clear and an awesome base qood enough for a medium size home. Extremely happy with the purchase. Got in on Amazon during an offer for INR2500 which is more than worth it."
karthik,1,India,25-06-2019,FALSE,2,Not use full.,Bad experience. Bad purchase. Not able to play songs other than Amazon play. Limited songs in Amazon. Response level also bad. Asking something respond something else. Called Amazon help line but no luck. With no option returned back. I prefer Google home mini. Flawless. I think it is for Indian users.
Amazon Customer,4,India,25-11-2019,FALSE,0,"Voce recognition is impressive. However, a lot is expected at the moment.","Impressive:1. Easy command recognition from a child of three years old.2. Good interpretation of the command, per se.Expectations:1. Acceptance of English and Hindi command simultaneously.2. Offering choices of singers when a particular song is sung by many artists. At present, it always starts with the same artist.3. Offering choices of different starting points and sequences. E.g. for a command of ""Bhajan"" or ""instrumental lullabies"" it starts with the same song/music and proceeds with the same sequence. Soon it becomes monotonous. This needs improvement4. Identifying voices of the members of the family and offering their types of music. With its excellent ability of identifying voice it seems to be easy to recognize and remember voice by names of the family members (and the rest by guest). Remembering choices of the family members and offering music accordingly would be expected. Obviously, a reset option is must in such cases."
Mukul,3,India,29-08-2021,FALSE,0,Overrated product,"Overall product is ok. But I'm not happy with the price and Alexa integration. She can recognize your voice from approx 10m of a distance. However, the recommendations/ suggestions provided by Alexa is not satisfactory. I mostly listen to music and the choices she makes are inexact. I mean idk how she come up with lame songs. For example, i have asked for Hollywood songs, she sometimes starts playing bhojpuri songs 😕😕, additionally i have asked her to repeat what i have asked and she replies the correct sentence, and that's more strange.Anyways, price comparing to product, price is too high i bought it for 2500 and i would be happy to buy it for approx 1500. But, more than 2000 is unacceptable for Alexa.Trust me, I regret buying this product. Also, it's not even wireless 🙄🙄🙄. It's app is too heavy which makes it too slow and so on.If you earn Luke crazy money, go for it... It's good for show off. However, if you are that person who thinks before buying, DON'T. BUY. IT. Pls, save your money for better things."
DK,5,India,16-10-2018,FALSE,0,VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT,it was a fantastic experience buying the 3rd generation ECHO DOT and to be honest this product is very much the worth buying the product is so that it is worth every penny for the investment and the amazon alexa is just much far better than the google home and the thing is it is very compact device with the powerful speaker and the accessibility with so many skills rather than anything is really amazing ....there is no issues with the product and the smart way it responds is very nice. amazon should try bringing out such unique products and for sure the demands for such will be more in coming days.
Aman K.,4,India,03-11-2018,FALSE,2,Box of happiness,The media could not be loaded.  I have been 2 weeks since I am using it. I am fun using this device. Alexa is like part of our family. Even my grandmom enjoys it. Mostly I am using it for playing music. It is able to play almost all songs. It would be great if we are able to play youtube videos also. Looking forward to exploring more abilities. Hope amazon guys add more skills like compatibility with youtube and gaana.The sound is good in a room. Alexa can hear you from some distance also. Though there are issues while hearing when it's playing on full volume.
customer,1,India,01-08-2021,FALSE,1,Bad Voice Recognition,"Amazon products are worst in terms of software. This one doesn't understand your words most of the times. Even if it does, it will play any random music, instead of the one you asked for."

Nitin K,4,India,11-12-2020,FALSE,0,Good toy for kids,"All is good with this device, don't understand how tough it would have been to integrate a battery into it. Worse, the power adapter is not industry standard Micro-USB or Type C. Amazon's way of making people dependent on their proprietary power adapter, and eliminating chance of powering it with a power bank"

Then it costs me around 2k which is worth it.Suggestions:- If this has options to control RGB lights which is in this speaker and it changes its light's with tempo is songs played would be very great."
V. Nair,4,India,24-06-2020,FALSE,1,Right after i purchased echo dot you lowered its price by 20%. unbelievable!,Product is good but the pricing is quite tricky. i purchased @ 3500 for fathers day special offer and the next day you put it up for 2799.So fathers day special price was higher than normal.

When I reviewed the product with this fact, I got call from executives promising refund and I returned the product. But it's 3 weeks now, I neither have the product nor the refund.

Deepak K.,4,India,21-08-2020,FALSE,0,Good Work Amazon,"Good work by Amazon... there are some glitches which hopefully should be fixed with updates, moving forward but with the price..I was looking for a portable speaker with small size but this serves as a Bluetooth speaker as well, plus having Alexa integration and support of all popular apps like gana, savan, Spotify and amazon music... overall satisfied and recommends to a casual buyers who don’t need too much bass and sound..."
Amar,4,India,20-10-2018,FALSE,0,One extra * for the sound!!!,"I was about to purchase the 2nd-gen while this one got just released. I barely remember having pre-ordered any stuff before...but I am glad that I did for the 3rd-gen! Amazing form factor and design, above average far-field speech recognition feature, and WHAT A SOUND!! One Star for extra only for the sound. Otherwise, the general Alexa capabilities are more or less the same across all Echo devices. The smart-home features are absolute fun to use too. Summing up, this device is a MUST BUY for music lovers, thanks to an unending list of accessible songs sourced through Amazon Music, Saavn and other 3rd party music streaming services. However, it would certainly take some time for general users in order to figure out how to optimally use the Dot and maximize Alexa's full capabilities - Amartya / Tech Reviewer"
Dr. Sourabh,2,India,07-09-2020,FALSE,0,Sound quality is not acceptable.,Alexa voice recognition is good. But sound quality is very disappointing. Even though volume is acceptablly high at all levels sound is muffled. There is no clarity in it. Alexa voice is difficult to interpret. Even songs are unpleasantly muffled. Other low cost bluetooth speakers also have better sound quality.

Venkatakrishnan,4,India,08-10-2019,FALSE,1,Decent enough smart speaker,"The sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity is awesome for such a small device. First and foremost thing to do after buying is to check the marketplace of your Amazon account. If it is global (. com), we have to send request to Amazon help team to change to (.in), otherwise, gaana, jiosaavn or even an android TV bought in india cannot be connected. However, Mostly can't recognize many words and skills in gaana and jio saavn."
Chandan,5,India,21-10-2020,FALSE,0,Small and Powerful.,"It's quite a simple, yet powerful device. While the voice recognition system still needs to improve. The range of microphones is wide and it wakes up on calling, instantly, most of the time. The speaker quality is good and pairing two of the for a stereo configuration will make it much better. Alexa works well as advertised and with additional skills, it can become better. Would love to see more regional language officially supported as it's right now restricted to Hindi only."
Kamlesh Wani,3,India,22-07-2019,FALSE,1,Service issue,Product is good but need to improve in following pointsSound quality.Some time Alexa is not recognise what we require exactly.Songs playing from hangama only not from others apps like sawan or Amazon prime etc.Device need to plugin only for 24/7 not on batteryNeed more flexibility in using like select multiple songs at a timeSongs selecting by movie name or singer wise etc.Not able to use a Bluetooth speaker

vinay shankar prasad,5,India,15-04-2020,FALSE,0,Very Nice Product of its category,Overall I am enjoying with Alexa. The best part I feel is day by day improvement in voice recognition and new features addition. I would like to suggest instead of adding individual features you can broadly categories and under that category developers can keep adding. From user side it wouldn’t be need to install all individual instead that only one can be enough

ashfoto,5,India,22-03-2019,FALSE,0,Best entry level smart speaker,This is definitely the best entry level smart speaker around. The sound quality is exceptionally good for its price. Usage is quite straightforward. It's awesome that you can stream bluetooth audio both to this speaker from any laptop/phone or to any audio device. Setup is really easy. The overall look is premium.

Mohammad Yasir,4,India,19-11-2020,FALSE,0,"It is not actually portable,","It is actually bigger in size than what is shown here. If you are song addict this is good for you, I mainly use it for setting up alarm as and when required with just a voice message to Alexa. One you have configured your voice profile through Alexa app it will recognise your voice very easily The best thing with Alexa is you need to say Alexa to let the device hear you instead of ""ok google"" in home google devices which is comparatively easier. Two things which I was completely unaware before purchasing the device that it needs to be continuously connected to power supply to work as it doesn't have any inbuilt battery and second it requires WiFi connection to work."
sada,4,India,03-02-2022,FALSE,0,"When it comes to automation,  this device is going to be helpful for beginners",This is able to recognize Indian accent really well and the drop in function is helpful for calling the device to talk to the person near the device. The smart plug can be scheduled and works seamlessly. Cons would be the sound is kindLoud but lacks clarity. The mid frequency needs to be tweeked for optimum clarity and rarely the device doesn't respond when we call Alexa
Subhasis Dash,5,India,10-08-2019,FALSE,0,Echo dot doesn't disappoint,"Its a great product by Amazon and I have been enjoying using it for quite a while now.Its can play songs,set alarm, reminders, make calls,order products and control your smart devices just by your voice commands.-You can give even commands from an other room it still captures it perfectly-you can also use it as a Bluetooth speaker for all you devices-But make sure you have a good internet connection otherwise it won't work well"

I am amazed with Alexa...she can do anything and everything as per instruction..more important she is listneing and follow your order perfectly .. Alexa is the only one who is listening me and do what I want , better than my wife ;)"
Rajita Ramachandram,1,India,30-07-2021,FALSE,1,Does not run on battery,Not mentioned in the description that it does not run on battery. So won't work when travelling unless connected to a plug point. It only runs on the power adapter. Returning it.
Santosh John Ross,5,India,08-10-2019,FALSE,0,Best Amazon product as on date,Just the uniqueness of the speaker and the ease of getting information and hearing songs.This is a must buy among all amazon products. Dont think twice just get it its awesome. Prerequisite is good wifi connection at home. Please note this speaker has to be connected to a powersource and the power block and cable is included n the box. Also amazon prime membership is a must. As I do have the above its everything I can ask for.
Manu Goyal,2,India,06-05-2021,FALSE,0,Connectivity Issue Everytime with Distorted Sound.,"I purchased Amazon Alexa 3rd Generation in November 2020. Since, April 2021 whenever I connect my phone through Bluetooth and play something on it through my phone, the sound that comes from it is distorted.And then I asked for help from amazon. They told me to purchase the same new device since it's a COVID pandemic, so I agreed and bought a new device, and when the device delivered to me after 4 days it was also having the same issue as the previous one, so I called in Amazon help services and registered a complaint, they told me to pair another mobile through Bluetooth so I paired during the phone call to Amazon helpline and played something on it, then it was working perfectly alright, but when I played through the new paired mobile on next day the sound was distorted.I recommend not to buy this device."
Adil,5,India,14-09-2020,FALSE,0,Amazon - best service ever,"Actually ,earlier it did not recognise my voice and I thought it is a device manufacturing issue but one thing I realised is that Amazon is far far better then any e- commerce company currently present in India. I mean I had put a bad review considering the unknowning fact about its language change in the device which I was not aware. I got a call from Ireland call centre asking me about the issue and trust me guys I am really IMPRESSED by the way, Amazon customer service representatives handled the issue. So, to all who face an issue with regards to voice recognition in the particular device can request for help through customer care and you will be amazed with the help and later usage.From now I am a Amazon user, Bye Bye Flipkart-!!"
Ameesh Bisaria,4,India,16-10-2019,FALSE,0,"Decent quality, nice improvisation over time, connectivity to speakers should improve","Alexa at first looks nice to use as you see diiferent skills/ activities it can perform. Eventually you get used to it or you stop using it i mean you get bored of what it does. I would like to see better integration with equipments, for me i have connected smart light which is working perfect but it is just not able to add or find my Bose speakers, that is a downsidr. They have to improve connectivity.I liked the fact they quite frequently update Alexa understanding power recently they added Hindi to Alexa. Otherwise also i have seen the Alexa improvising on its data.Speaker quality is not too impressive but good decent quality at this price point.Overall I am happy with this just make sure that you buy if you want to integrate it in your daily routine otherwise it will be just lying on the side."
Sujata,5,India,02-10-2019,FALSE,0,New Alexa Echo Dot uses 12volt round pin charger,"Got my new echo dot 3rd Gen just now. This is my second echo dot purchase. Its bigger and heavier than the older echo dot. Much better sound quality. Its charging pin is different. It does not use the 5volts micro usb to power-up , it instead uses a 12volt round pin. So you cannot use the power charger on any other device. I liked the older power adapter. I could use it to charge my android phone , my smart watch, my fitness band, my portable usb speaker, my power bank, and even my table top webcam. I can’t do that now."
Anand kumar,4,India,04-11-2019,FALSE,0,"Amazon Alexa is good one, so just buy and enjoy ..!!","Amazon Echo 3rd Gen is really a good personal assistant and it's price worth.It's features1. Easy to connect from your android phone.2. Easy to play songs, listen news, Headlines, weekly news, sports news and many more.3. Able to answer basics questions easily but sometimes it's not able to search on Google and it will then reply by saying "" o don't know that.4. Good sound quality ( really good Bass )5. At the price of 2000 INR. It's a good speaker as comparison to others. So don't wait more thinking to buy or not. Just order it and enjoy the Amazon Alexa.6. One thing should be needed is that it's connectivity from Google or any other sear h engine. So that it can search over that and can find easly the answer of any question ask by the user.7. And also need to improve some security features over securing users data and some sound detection mechanism.8. Overall it's a good speaker along with a good personal assistant."

Abhijit Rajak,5,India,29-12-2021,FALSE,0,My first Smart Speaker,Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English.7. Now Amit ji voice on alexa but Alexa sweet enough to entertain you.
Shailesh M. Gupte,5,India,23-06-2019,FALSE,0,Amazing Device,"Sound Quality Amazing, Bluetooth Connectivity Wonderful, Portability as expected ... as it is a wired device. The Third generation Echo dot is a bit tricky when need to connect to the internet for the first time. Do not get confused by selecting Echo & Alexa or All devices. You may hit a dead end. Go into the menu on the top right corner ( the three horizontal lines) and select ""Add Device""... then you will get a option to add the ""3rd Generation Echo Dot"" the steps further are easy.... enjoy :)"

The charging cable of the adapter was in tangled state, and the binding rubber of the wire was not even inside the box.3. The plastic seal was not present in the device. (on the top of interface)4. Even while setting up, I had to reset it to complete the installationWhy did you sent a refurbished product when I ordered for a new one??I will make sure Amazon pays for this!!"
Hardy Joyson,3,India,03-12-2019,FALSE,0,"Its just hardware aesthetics, needs to improve a lot","Alexa response sucks every time, asked for coconut, gave me mango. Even I play a song, then if I need to turn it off or change, should do it manually. Alexa wont recoganize your voice while playing songs. I Cant really call or message anyone to phone, for that other end person also need to register on Alexa. You guys need to improve software quality. Otherwise its just speaker with microphone and internet hub."
Siddhartha,4,India,05-10-2019,FALSE,0,"Great speaker, average voice assitant","Common guys you need to fix the amazon music search results, I search for a song and it gives me a different results and I cant find the original song until I specifically mention the singer. Its very annoying when YouTube music works flawless, sadly there is no inter-compatibility with each other.Also why cant I change the voice, it sounds so robotic, make a better alternative, its one thing that's keeping me away from making it my default voice assistant.Everything else is just great. Sound has much more depth. Google home mini is tuned for better vocal response while echo is for music"
shorya srivastava,5,India,20-01-2022,FALSE,0,Very good device for 1st experience as a home device,Recieved the product in less then 24 hours from amazon with price of 2399 rs. I can say that it's better then gen-4. I have setup the device in my hall. And the sound it produces is immersive. Alexa integration is superb as well as voice recognition. Setup process is very simple. I also got amazon power plug and havels wifi bulb. I paired all three device in 2 minutes. And then it is ready to go. I can say that one should give it a try to have the experience of technology. Completely satisfied 🙂

Pritam Batabyal,3,India,01-01-2019,FALSE,1,Great device but much more information has to be added,"Please add the capability to read my mails from gmail, yahoo, outlook., Etc.Please add notifications from Facebook as well and other common messengers.Right now it is not able to remember user information, make it remember so user information.Let it help in navigationLet it allow to call take conference calls through Skype office, etc.Add for features so that one can use it to study engineering, medical, etc. Currently it lags in this field.Add features of sports commentary, etc.Add more AI to it."
JOHN.P.ALEXANDER,3,India,09-06-2019,FALSE,1,Not up to the mark.,"Alex has limitions even in searching songs it's more like a smart speaker plus if we use additional plugs and switches, lights which are costly in market ,Alex may be useful for a person who brought this item for this price. My suggestion is give Alex the freedom to search through net and find answers and songs to his owner."
Vijay,3,India,29-07-2021,FALSE,1,Not recognizing Telugu Music,"Alexa is good for bollywood and hollywood songs when it comes to tollywood and other regions languages such as telugu, tamil Alexa is not responding properly. Infact it's unable to recognize telugu music(Albams). It's needs to improve more in recognizing regional languages."
suhail farmaan,5,India,18-10-2020,FALSE,0,MUST HAVE PRODUCT,The media could not be loaded.  Never realised that Alexa was this amazing until I purchased one.If you have a proper WiFi connection at homeIf you have smart devices and controllable electronics Alexa is a must have device for you. Go for it. Over a month of experiencing the hands free way of performing multiple tasks Alexa has been an incredible device and software for my everyday use. The speakers are really great for the price we pay. Go for it.I have purchased 3 unites and over all this is worth it
J Chillin,4,India,27-11-2018,FALSE,0,Good product with better sound compared to the echo 2,Voice recognition is good and sound reproduction is surprisingly good for the size. I was surprised as to how deap the bass reproduction vs my bluetooth speak. Coupled with Amazon music its a great way to pass the time.The skills lists are limited but I think as popularity grows so will the skills catalog.This product will become more powerful and useful as time goes on in terms of home automation.I highly recommend you avoid the older version of the echo dot. This version is far superior in everyway.

Raj,3,India,12-11-2019,FALSE,0,Need to improve out side entertainment skills,Echo was good with superb sound bought along with wipro smart bulb... both are working as I expect... but echo has to improve skills rather than entertainment....most of the time i ended with not getting as I want.... mainly after query echo has to repeat the query and then it follows... but no need to repeat the query...... makes user more comfortable

Abhinav,4,India,20-11-2020,FALSE,0,Awesome but kinda lacking,"The product is really good, dont judge the sound quality by its size, its heavily boosted bass makes us go crazy for the song, voice recognition is great even during noisy conditions one thing that it lacks is the portability it needs a power source connected to a socket all the time but for this price point there are real good Bluetooth speakers hence if Amazon could come up with wireless echo speaker it would be really good, I also bought the wipro bulb with the combo ajd integrated it with echo dot and it it awesome. You can change brightness colour preset modes jist with your voice but it requires the bulb and echo dot to be connected to the same network all the time"
MOHAK G.,2,India,07-04-2020,FALSE,0,Pathetic connectivity of the product,"I have been using Alexa Echo Dot from last one week.My house has a very good wifi connection but Alexa always has trouble connecting to the Internet.It understands what I say but never play songs. Most of the time, it does not understand clear English words as well.Alexa app shows the song, but Alexa does not understand the same keywords to play a song.Overall, I would not suggest the product at all. Do not waste your money on such useless product that most of time won't play music for you for which it is purchased."
Siddharth,5,India,20-11-2018,FALSE,0,Age of the AI!,"The thing is exactly what you come to expect it. Rise of the machines!Clever programming and machine learning gives this device the ability to quickly search the cloud for answers and add information to it constantly which makes it smarter. The 3rd gen echo dot (relative to 2nd gen) sounds better, has better listening capability, and it looks great. The voice and the programming is the same as the cloud so nothing changes there. I'll wait and see what future capabilities it gets and it should be an interesting time with the companion robots. Get it by all means. It's a good investment."
Parul jain,5,India,15-06-2020,FALSE,0,Better than Google home mini at cost of Rs. 3000,"Best home usable device for entertainment.. If you are thinking to buy it or not, then I'm sure that you will get thrill and enjoy after buying it. I was also thinking same but then I bought it for Rs.3000 during discount period. So, wait and buy it when it goes to price of Rs.3000 or below.Currently, it is Rs. 3500 but wait and I""'m sure that it will go down to Rs.3000 within a 1 or 1.5 month. Just wait and check regularly the price of this product (check daily atleast once).If you thinking to buy google home mini, then don't buy at all, I've experienced both. Echo dot is thousand times better that it. Google home mini don't recogine your voice well and can't perform e-commercial and play games activities."

Raadhiika,5,India,24-03-2019,FALSE,0,Alexa is the best,Alexa is the best product I should say. The voice recognition is improved along with the sound quality. Songs availability is great right from Abhangwani till English hiphop songs.

Amazon Customer,4,India,18-12-2020,FALSE,0,Good buy if price is around 2000,I bought this in offer in 2290. I liked the product as the speaker quality is good for a bedroom size. The voice recognition is good. Overall the Alexa works fine but of course there are flaws in understanding of instructions by Alexa because artificial intelligence is still just the tip of the iceberg. I don't think it would have been a good buy if bought above this price.
Gayatri Sharma,1,India,23-01-2021,FALSE,1,ANNOYED! Echo dot playing random music without me giving command!!,"My echo dot is playing absolutely random music on its own, without me giving any command.

One restriction is Amazon music which is not with Google MiniOverall fantastic device and fun to use"
KB,3,India,21-07-2019,FALSE,0,Not upto the mark.,It makes no sense to buy this for 4500. That was the price when I got it. The product is currently priced at 2500 or something. Even then it's better to get JBL or spend some extra to get sony if you want to use it as a Bluetooth speaker only. Glinfact Google home is a better option than this if you are looking for smart home services.
Harsh,1,India,04-06-2020,FALSE,2,I brought it so I can use it as a speaker phone only!,It can't call any mobile numbers. Can only call the contacts having echo device or may be alexa app and account.

Sathish Reddy,5,India,10-01-2019,FALSE,0,Works perfectly as it's intend to do,"Works very well. Detects my audio from another room also. Multiple microphones are working in a perfect way.

People in USA can. I'm giving the product 3 stars in place of 5 only because of this flaw. It's big enough a flaw for me to switch to Google Home instead, even if it isn't as good as the Echo in other aspects."
Falconato,1,India,18-11-2019,FALSE,2,Echo Dot Sucks. BIG TIME.,"Alexa needs some real upgrade in general. As for the Echo Dot 3rd Gen, VERY POOR Voice Recognition. I literally have to yell for Alexa to listen. Be it cranking the volume, changing tracks, or anything whatsoever. Had quite some expectations since I proudly own a fire stick. Even after buying the speaker (which I bought mainly for the purpose so that all my favorite music could come in handy), I still prefer to play music on my TV than on my speaker. I mean why buy a speaker if you can't even play music on it without a fuss. Overall, it's a big NO. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED."

Ashutosh T,5,India,27-12-2021,FALSE,0,Quality product with a variety of uses,Echo Dot 3rd gen is an absolutely amazing device. It works as expected and has great amount of features. Th sound signature is good and Alexa works 100pc of the time. Although there is room for improvement in voice recognition when there is too much noise in the room or fan is running and search results of Alexa also needs some improvements. Overall a great product at good price
Jashan,3,India,21-09-2020,FALSE,0,Useless after a while,I know people make a really productive of use of alexa but it really isnt useful if youre just wanting to get it for entertainment purposes as the speaker quality isnt that great if youre planning to listen to music and it overalls gets booring after a while and would lie unplugged in a corner of a room.

I know it s too late to buy 3rd gen while 4th gen is coming in short time. I was thinking about 4th gen but my budget didnt allowed me to buy that so I went for echo dot 3rd gen with Wipro smart bulb for ₹2299. I had another option too like dad said me to choose between Nike Mid by air shoes or Alexa!!There isnt any other smart speaker better than Echo dot and Alexa... she s so amazing I loved her response time and also whisper to talk silently in the middle of night!!I was also thinking about Google Nest (home) mini but I saw many many positive reviews about echo dot and also watched hundreds of videos before buying this.PS- My mum was denying about alexa and she said what do to with useless speaker. I must say she s only who totally used alexa from it s arrival!!"

Rest all is fun to use easy to connect, takes time to understand human brains but it's over all fun to have one at home. And makes you little lazy as I have connected all my other device to eco dot. With just one command I take control of my whole house. Best part I can switch on lights remotely even if I am not at home. So my pet is well taken care. Need to improve on sound out put, as this is more like a personal speaker then really good sound out put."
sunny,3,India,24-03-2019,FALSE,0,Mixed experience. Not so bad not so good.,The media could not be loaded.  Its awesome in some cases. Its big as my palm. Nice build quality. Some features needed to be upgraded. App needs upgradation. Voice recognition is so good. Convert your voice to text is so fast and accurate. Search result is so fast. But some times it goes out of control. While playing music it can not hear your voice. Your need to shout then. Some time i asked to record and it turns on my light. Good futurastic product but still need to work on it more. App is not up to that mark. Alexa is smart but app isn’t. Packaging is good. Delivery was on time. Buttons are nice. Lights are so good to eyes. Sound is not loud or balanced to replace my other Bluetooth speaker. Sounds boomy. Need youtube skill urgently.

Harshith kamble,5,India,03-09-2021,FALSE,0,BEST for SMART Homes.,"You can buy it with no hesitation. But my suggestion is the people who are looking to or having a SMART HOME like everything in your house is automated with Voice command it's good for you. And for the normal houses it's just act like a Bluetooth Speaker that's it somewhere around in a corner laying in your house. If you want to BUY it first convert your house like smart bulbs, tubelights, android TV, remote enabled fans, Ac's. Normal houses just a speaker that you can talk when bored for entertainment."
Rahul Saha,4,India,18-07-2019,FALSE,0,The blue lightened Alexa!,"Amazon have done a great job with the 360 sound output. Clearly out runs google Assistant in bass domain, although google’s output is little soothing to ear. Great accuracy of microphone and voice recognition. In terms of intelligence google wins by slight margin, but Alexa works great for normal D2D usage. Works seamlessly with fire stick and build quality looks premium."
Priti Nagpal,5,India,26-08-2021,FALSE,0,"Its an amazing product, just read my review.","I find this product really helpful and it helps in my school work also. I love music so whenever I ask her to play my favourite song, she plays it very well. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations : 1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time. 2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass. 3. Several skills are available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder. 4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff. 6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to Alexa also motivates them to talk in English too."
Umesh Gupta,2,India,05-10-2019,FALSE,0,Long way to go Alexa,"Pros1. Sound Quality Superb,2. device looks great stylish.3. Alexa is too good only in those things which are shown in TV ad. Dim the light, play animal sound, so on. But world does not end here.Cons1. Integration with other device poor and take lot of time. Software and app working is poor.2. Voice recognition - Extremely poor especially when volume is above 5. Sometime I have scream, You feel like better Google kar leta kaha Alexa ko bola diya. 😀3. Music - When you say play 90s songs, it starts with same set and sequence of songs. Boring.4. Every time we have keep for charging.5. After Wipro smart bulb price deduction, effectively Alexa cost me 1700/-, but won't feel worth. As a speaker only yes it is.At last Good affords by Amazon but long way to go."

Jack,3,India,30-11-2018,FALSE,0,Alexa review after a month use.,Alexa's reviews for sound is not as mentioned. Without Amazon prime subscription Alexa is incomplete to full fill our satisfaction.

Santosh Kumar Nayak,3,India,18-06-2019,FALSE,0,A good product but not the best,"Bluetooth connectivity is very very poor. As while trying to run music or video in phone, it's not getting transmitted clearly from phone to Echo Dot. The sound output in Echo Dot is almost in poorest form and playing in breaking voice, even am keeping the phone nearer to device.Sound quality comparing other bluetooth speakers is marginally better but not the best.Portability: The product very much portable to easily carry anywhere.After using just for one day, am feeling as if I should return the product."
CHOPRAMO,5,India,20-03-2019,FALSE,0,Absolutely superb,"Alexa has the capability to change lives. It is constantly improving and skills are being added almost continuously . The build quality is excellent and the sound quality is excellent for the size. We use Alexa to play music, turn on/off lights. Turn on/off ac. The possibilities are endless."
Sangramsingh,3,India,17-11-2021,FALSE,0,Sound gets distorted at higher volumes.,It's versatile in the sense that everyone at home can play almost whatever they like. But most songs available on Amazon music are not recognized by voice commands. You need to search them on phone and then cast on the speaker. Also I think a wall mount should be included in the package.
Dipak Mavani,5,India,15-11-2019,FALSE,0,Very Useful and quite perfect. Pleasant Indian ascent female voice.,Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is very nice small smart speaker. It takes alexa instruction very well and most of the time responds perfectly. Alexa's Indian ascent female voice is very nice and pleasant. Its microphone is sensitive and hears any male female voice from distance of 10-15 feet.This speaker can be easily connected to home theater through Aux cable and or also through Bluetooth.

Waste software which is injected to Echo Dot... It dont listen to me I need to put my mouth near by and say alexa stop song... when echo dot playing song from online.. if i play from Bluetooth just for testing... both songs at a time it will play.... it wont stop... voice recognition is very very bad i can say. We can go for better option than this in same budget.. i feel there is no security with your privacy...

Vikas Malik,5,India,07-05-2019,FALSE,0,Awesome Alexa,"My review is based on the experience I have had in the past 24 hours resulting in me ordering second Echo Dot for my parents!!!1) Operations: Getting Echo Dot to start working is quick and simple for those who have a fair idea about various apps. The gadget is controlled by the Amazon Alexa Application which can be downloaded for free from the iOS Apps / Google Play store.2) Adding Skills: Since Alexa works on AI mechanism, we have to add a lot of skills to it since it comes with very few pre-possessed skills. Adding skills or I can say enabling skills will take some time as you have over 10,000 skills to choose from; however, it was simple and fun.3) Voice Recognition: This is really a cool feature since it enables Alexa to identify the user and respond to it accordingly. It takes about 5-10 minutes to add each user voice sample.4) Sound Quality: It is a decent sound quality compared to the price tag Echo Dot is being offered this Summer Sale (Can consider the cashback offer @ 10% as well). The best part is that you can add Bluetooth speakers as I was able to pair my F&D Speaker as well as JBL Flip 4 speaker in a jiffy. Believe you me, it is really quick and easy. Therefore, you may not worry much about the sound quality...5) Features: Since it only 24 hours, I am still exploring the entire range of activities Alexa can perform for you but as I have already spent almost last 10 out of 24 hours fiddling around with the gadget and the associated applications, I can tell the readers that you are in for awesome surprises... I shall not disclose the same to maintain the surprise. As already mentioned, since Alexa has got an Artificial Intelligence, the more you interact with the app, the more it gets acquainted with your usage and adopts response. You also have the option to add or remove the outcome of a command... For Example: consider saying Good Morning Alexa and you can choose the response like wishing good morning, giving you news brief from selected news apps, play selected songs and also change the sequence of response.Just to Conclude: This is a great opportunity to save on a must-have device, and even if those who missed out the deal, don't get disheartened as you won't regret the decision of gifting yourself or your loved ones a great gadget which I am sure will be a part of everyone's day-to-day routine."

It plays everything instantly without any glitches. Really happy with the voice quality which is not shrill at all, the bass is just so good. It's so soothing actually. And everything plays without any advertisement- which is the bestest thing.. Thank you Amazon!!!"
VS,3,India,17-08-2021,FALSE,1,Nice Device for quick info,"Good Sound quality, vast collection base, Alex will get confused with some of the request, need to reorganize the search criteria and information from different source. Only disadvantage is that always it should be connected to power supply, without which Alex won't work. I suggest Amazon to make Alex battery enabled so that we can charge and use it quite often."
Manjunath Janardhan,5,India,22-10-2019,FALSE,0,Brought again,"I have been using Echo Plus (1st Gen) since launch and wanted one more so got this one. I have Google Home too but it is not as good as Alexa. 99.9 % Alexa recognises my speed voice and 100% of my family members to control Smart Lights , Fire Stick and into. Planning to get Echo Show as well."
P,5,India,23-05-2019,FALSE,0,Just go for it!,"Wow! I have echo 2nd generation too. There is huge difference between 2nd and 3rd generation. This one is more sturdy, more stylish and speaker quality is just amazing. I ordered this for my parents. They could set it to easily so m happy with that!They love using this primarily for news and songs. They use it extensively to control all wireless lights too.They are waiting for regional language updates and keep experimenting with alexa everyday :)Thank you amazon!"
Oliver Fernandes,2,India,25-02-2020,FALSE,0,Follow up mode and some words are not recognized,"I have a problem with this particular echo dot. Second gen did not and that worked perfectly fine.

There is nothing more for me to do except wait for another 3-5 days for the issue to get resolved by amazon services."
Sankha,5,India,22-09-2020,FALSE,0,Small and loud,"Alexa please review yourself.Hi I am Alexa I can do a lot by just taking to youYes Alexa has lot of customisation.

Both have display and work fine. I want to buy Echo Dot from longtime but didn’t buy it as there was no good sale going on.Recently, Amazon put combo deal offer for Rs 5499 which includes Echo Dot(3rd generation), Oakter smart switch 6A, HD fire tv stick. So I would say it’s worth every single penny.Reasons1) If you have prime membership then buy this combo pack during sale day. I got around 56 percent discount. Echo devices can help you with smart switches, smart lights, smart ac, etc. But, if you don’t have prime membership then don’t buy.2). You can control your tv using fire tv stick through echo devices using voice command.So, you need both to perform such task. But incase, you have low budget then I suggest you to buy fire tv. It has built in alexa and can perform smart devices task. But, remember you need to buy subscription separately for fire tv streaming application.3) Oakter switch is not worth the Mrp but if you get a combo deal at good price then buy it. It doesn’t require hub and has it’s own application."
Smriti ,1,India,28-11-2020,FALSE,2,This device will stop working after the warranty expires.,This device will stop working after the warranty expires. This is one of the most pathetic experience I’ve ever had with a tech device. Wasn’t expected out of amazon!
Sam,1,India,19-09-2020,FALSE,1,Nice buy costely,I bought first Alexa 3500 work preety well but after few days I saw same item in amazon from same seller cloud tail in 2399 why there is big price difference. That mean this product doesn't value 3500So stop fooling customer.

Prathipati Vijaya Kumar,1,India,30-01-2019,FALSE,2,Worst Buy,"Just like any other voice response. Not better. Have to speak aloud and clear.When gadget and the Echo Dot are connected on same wifi, outputs quite slurry audio. Always asks to get help from Alexa App.. Why do I use a voice response for?? Better buy a Bluetooth speaker and browse gadgets."
Yudi,1,India,25-02-2019,FALSE,2,Doesn't reply and limited English music in India,"The media could not be loaded.  The product is pretty much a 4-5 stars. But, in India, the choice of English music is limited. That would be about 2 stars. Maybe Saavn concentrates more on Hindi music. Example, it didn't have Simon and Garfunkel in their library. It played David Simon. Also, using it after a year, it lights when i say ""Alexa"", but it doesn't respond to the command given (although it shows the blue ring). I want an exchange ASAP!"
Mitesh Mehta,4,India,16-09-2020,FALSE,0,Value for money,"Its a very nice addition to your house. a perfect asst. The price that it comes at, its totally value for money.

Perfect for gifting as well."

It never shows online (except I do log out and login then it shows online only once). I can't set any skill, routine, alarm anything if the device is offline.This device is waste for me now and I can't see any support for Alexa devices. My internet connection is good.I am not gonna buy any Amazon product in future."
Minni A.,5,India,18-09-2020,FALSE,0,"Bought two, very happy and satisfief",I bought echo dot 3rd gen and was so happy with it that I bought echo input s week after. The ease of using without the phone or laptop is great. The sound is good enough. Obviously it cannot compare with big standalone speaker. I have connected the dot to my big speakers and using input in any room I want because it is portable
Priya Rajagopalan,3,India,17-06-2020,FALSE,0,Good for music lovers and smart homes not a product for working men n women,Echo dot as a device it's really good.. the sound effect is pretty loud more than expected.. on software side it needs lots of improvement. The microphone won't work for calls or meetings.. so this echo dot device is pretty good for music lovers and smart homes but not for regular use.. we can't use this device like other Bluetooth devices.. n one more main issue u can't carry it bcoz it needs to plugged in to work..
Ashwarya Meena,4,India,07-10-2019,FALSE,1,Buy in Amazon sales Not in regular price .,Echo Dot 3rd Gen .Pros - 1. Better sound quality then 2nd gen echo Dot and Google home mini . Echo Dot 3rd Gen has decent amount of Bass also .2. Build Quality is superb .3. It's Blue light looking soo Dashing .4 . It's english recognition is very Good and In english language it's answer all the questions . ButCons - 1. In Hindi language it's performance is not mind blowing . In hindi it has desent performance . Amazon should work in hindi language .I suggest you to buy amazon echo Dot in Amazon sales Not in regular price .Thank you .
Manisha Chhabra,1,India,22-08-2020,FALSE,1,Pathetic Products,Not at all worthy. Wastage of money. Performance is not good. And Amazon is not cooperating for return. I got the exchange product today but as usual the set up button is so uncomfortable and its painful to press it for a longer time. And the sound quality is so pathetic that music doesn't seems to melodies. It feels like a non branded local speaker. As usual the wrist product from Amazon. Really unexpected from a Amazon. Very disappointing and Amazon team is not even ready to give my money back.
pushpa,3,India,30-03-2021,FALSE,0,Consider this only if you are ok with random things otherwise you need a lot of patience for this.,What I hate is it skips songs from a playlist.I have saved Sundarkand which has 4 parts in Amazon music.Alexa skips part 2 or 3 and plays the next one.This has happened 4-5 times.I have written to alexa help center but no response on this.I have gone back to mobile app .
Antony a.,1,India,29-10-2019,FALSE,2,Not worth  .its cheap quality,I bought eco 3rd generation for just rupees 2499 on 15days bk. I returned product after too days it's working sometimes only always we need to go for reset mode and connect it. I don't understand such a non compatible product why amazon incresing price day by day. It's a local China product .they need to increase quality
SJOHN,4,India,28-10-2018,FALSE,1,All-new Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa-- Just Okey,"using this product for couple of weeks now... its not really value for the money unless you have all Alexa compatible devices at home and has an amazon prime subscription! many of the ""other"" product like smartTV or Bluetooth speakers will not work properly( you may require individual product applications to allow connectivity to Alexa!!)Mainly there is no built-in battery; hence require to be connected to power always!!"

Like ""ALEXA GAANA BAJA"" and Alexa start as per past choice, same way """"Alexa chup"" and it stop..!!!Updates are great .. just love it."
Amazon Customer,3,India,19-02-2022,FALSE,0,Good. No Battery power. No charm,Like.Product is good. Integration with Amazon music is good.DislikeNo battery back up. So it occupies the power point. Not portable as well. Major disadvantage for the price paid. The same size of branded wireless speakers are far cheaper.
Sudeep,3,India,25-10-2019,FALSE,0,A long way to go to be truly Smart.,"No wonder Amazon has tried hard to make this speaker smart but it fails to expect as per the aura which has been built around this product.At most this is a 'Smart Music Player' and not a smart assistant. The alexa needs to improve a lot. Alexa responds only to simplest of requests and responce in a little twisted scenario goes out for a six.Voice quality of speaker is good. The recognition capacity of Microphone is outstanding.Overall it is a safe purchase and can be bought. I hope Amazon improves it over a period of time. (Yes, I mean a lot)."
Amit Sinha,3,India,06-12-2021,FALSE,0,Very good product,"It is very good but not searching like Google, maximum time reply that I don't know....limited news & radio station.. More improvement required. If you want to know about some one, alexa reply ""don't know"" but Google always tell about that."
GSingh,5,India,21-10-2018,FALSE,0,Cute dot,This is a mini speaker with decent sound output. It connects with apple & android devices by WiFi or Bluetooth. We can use it as a Bluetooth speaker. It's my children's favourite toy. Better than giving them phone 📱/ tablet / TV 📺 .Only drawback is that it must be connected to a power souce.
Sahil Vasudev,3,India,31-12-2021,FALSE,0,Always Hearing after 2 to 3 calls,The product is solid and always require electricity to run.Upon initiating it doesn't make any sound like it8is working mode now.Always hear after 2 to 3 calls of alexa very poor voice recognition.Sound quality is good
Suresh Payannavar,1,India,04-03-2020,FALSE,2,Don't buy this product it will stop working after 1 year.,Hi FriendsDon't buy this product after 1 year it will stop working automatically. So don't waste your hard earned money. I have purchased this product on 24th Oct 2018 now it's stopped working. Investing 4k for one year it's not worth so don't buy this product.

So him many times sin this world I should keep saying alexa alexa... It fails to understand commands properly and this setup issue. Mmn then to connect to my cel phone Bluetooth was another saga. N now again it's not connecting.I think those who want a good speakers should go for JBL, harman or bose or other brands with just manual Bluetooth option and not waste money in this"
Milan J.,5,India,13-07-2019,FALSE,1,If you get a good deal buy it.,"I was looking for portable speakers and I got a great deal on Echo For which had these additional features.I bought it for the following reasons:1. Workable sound quality2. AI features3. It is the future :PThings that might tick you:1. It isn't portable, needs a plug at all times,2. Connecting to WiFi may get you white hair,3. Alexa doesn't listen to you at all times, If you yell on Alexa then you might get some from your parents saying 'Have you lost it!!'Enjoy :-D"
Lionking,5,India,18-07-2019,FALSE,0,Bang for the buck,"This was my second Echo device for another room. Really happy with the voice quality. Amazon earlier used to provide Echo dot with micro usb pin which means it could be played outdoor with a suitable powerbank but the 3rd gen echo dot has a proprietary power pin which rules out the outdoor use altogether. Nevertheless, happy with the product."
Bhuvanesh,3,India,29-01-2022,FALSE,0,Review after one month uses.,"Feature wise review.1. Sound quality - 5 star (loud and clear).2. Voice recognition - 43. Alexa Intergration - 34. Smart features - 3.55. Alexa Skills - 2.5There is a lot of improvement neede in terms of Alexa skills as it doesn't work well in most of the scenario such as Alexa is not able to give you search results based on your exact location. In one scenario, I was searching for Dominos to check its efficiency, It gave me the nearest result which was not even in my city, even though my wifi, gps was ON and the location was well marked on google maps as well."
Pads,4,India,12-12-2019,FALSE,0,Good but older iteration is better,"The older version of echo dot is better w.r.t sound quality, though this has a better volume speaker. Other features are as with the earlier version, works great , BT is good, mic has long range detection , Alexa works great as always."
sandeep,5,India,24-07-2020,FALSE,0,Nice Product,Product is good. Received safe. Works very good with amazon music but other music services gaana and hungama are ok not upto mark and should be improved. Connectivity to FM stations also ok bit regional fm stations connectivity should be improved . Mostly regional language music and selected movies albums search should be improved more.Also no integration to wynk
Ashima,4,India,15-07-2021,FALSE,0,Not clear in instructions,Well it was an offer with 12 watt smart bulb. Offer said pay 200 rs more and get 12 watt bulb. Unfortunately did not say anywhere that the price if alexa will be reduced abd bulb would cost me 700 rs.That was misleading. I could have saved the money. Sorry but feel like cheated.
Aman Verma,5,India,10-10-2019,FALSE,0,"Alexa, you are really smart!","Let me tell you this, the speaker used inside echo dot 3 can be really too loud. It's an amazing device with lot of skills that can be added. Works flawlessly on detecting trigger commands and answers with some good wit. The most important part of it being able to train on multiple skills. I bought it during the sale with Syska smart bulb, and after configurig the device, the bulb can 3 controlled easily from alexa. I have also paired it up with my fire stick .Go for it guys you won't regret a smart device like her."
Arpit Parekh,5,India,04-10-2019,FALSE,1,Alexa is indeed smart and helpful.,"This product is really amazing. I also got Wipro smart lamp for free during sale. This is so addictive. Voice recognition is very good. Though I found google assistant more smarter and knowledgeable, Alexa is also very good. There are so many skills."
Manjunath,4,India,19-08-2021,FALSE,0,Never get bored if you are music lover (Just say play song name),Need to integrate with Kannada FM channels and news channels. It’s playing only ajtak news headlines.We don’t have option to change name of Alexa .If they add new feature it’s plus point for them.Apart from this for me it’s worth to buy below 2.5k.
SVS,5,India,30-07-2019,FALSE,0,MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF AI SPEAKER,"This was my first purchase of AI speaker and I must tell that I am very happy the way this market has begun.Surely there is lot to improve but what the package is offering at current price on the new product category launch is very impressive.Connectivity with firestick can be improved a bit, currently pause and resume command works good but finding the movie and hit play is hard process.Other then that look is awesome but I have heared google home and I would say that google sound was little better then echo.Still highly recommend this one."
Verified buyer,5,India,03-07-2019,FALSE,0,Good speakers at a very good price,Got this speaker in a flash sale. Bought it for my daughter and she enjoys having conversation with alexa and she is happy that alexa can help her with playing her favourite songs. amazing technology. go for it . you will not be disappointed. get the feel of experience.
Rohan Jadhav,5,India,28-09-2019,FALSE,0,Must have for a smart home,"Alexa is one of the best things that you can purchase if you want to upgrade to a smart lifestyle. I have become completely dependent on Alexa now. It plays songs directly from amazon music, helpful for setting reminders, alarms, asking random questions, and most important of all, to toggle on/off the lights without having to get up."
Prem_Physique,5,India,30-07-2019,FALSE,0,Amazing product,"Its cute,its loud,its simply amazing. It needs very littke space and it becomes one in your family. I use alexa to play a lot of music and control few smart home devices(lights,tv etc). And it never disappoints only wish it had a built in battery."
Amazon Customer,5,India,05-06-2020,FALSE,0,Useful 5 stars...But beware of privacy,Arrived very fast and in good condition.. Sound very clear compared to mobile speakers..The Alexa app in google play has bugs..I had to reinstall Alexa app to change the wake word.. .Very useful..Helps in saving time...Only Concern is privacy...Note: Even mute button does not stop recording...Only way is to turn off the switch to safeguard privacy when in important conversations or when not in use...
Abhishek,5,India,02-10-2019,FALSE,2,Alexa Echo Dot 3rd Gen,It's works amazingly well.Connecting it to wifi is very simple nd easy.If u r not able to understand from the user guide.See 1 or 2 videos on YouTube ...it's very Simple
Sagar Thorat,2,India,16-07-2019,FALSE,0,Version issue in Amazon Echo dot purchased in PRIME DAY SALE,"The echo dot which I purchased in the Prime day sale is of an older version. When I try to update it with the guidelines given on Amazon's official site, my Alexa says the device is up to date. The version showing for my Alexa is 1308943236 whereas the Latest version is ""Echo Dot (3rd Generation) Latest Software Version: 2584225924"". The reason why Amazon is selling the devices at a cheaper rate is they are selling the older versions which are not up to date. And the device is not getting updated also. My friend bought the device before a sale and he has the updated version and mine is older."
Ben,5,India,28-10-2020,FALSE,0,A good entry level smart Speaker bought @2k,"A bit suprised by how lpud the speaker is, voice recognition is good with the fan on at full speed.Tried using an RCA to Aux to connect this to an old Sony BluRay. This allowed me to play songs from my phone on the old Sony, but frankly the audio could be way louder and clearer.The Wipro smart bulb works without issues."
Srid,5,India,19-07-2019,FALSE,0,A really nice smart speaker,I initially had a thought that this is still in a premature stage but after activating some of the Alexa skills I am able to get most of the things that I was looking for. Really awesome product and the price I got this for in Amazon sale makes it worth for every single paisa spent. Simply awesome.
krishna k.,2,India,08-10-2019,FALSE,1,Long way to go Alexa,"At 50% volume sould quality is good , beyond that it’s sounds horribleBiggest drawback, alexa doesn’t respond on full volume at 4 ft distanceAlexa application hangs up very often and stops the responseBluetooth connectivity, lagging most of the time"
Rohan,3,India,19-11-2020,FALSE,0,Failed to respond,"Maybe I was unlucky as Alexa at times didn’t respond to voice commands. We have jiofiber at home with speeds upto 150 mbps, given the internet speeds Alexa should not have problems with responding to voice commands. Returned the product and was disappointed, could be one of defective product."
SK,3,India,16-08-2019,FALSE,0,Better sound put poor mic,"First of all cheers to cloudtail. As always great service and genuine products. This 3rd gen Dot is much better in aspect of sound quality ( the speaker role) in comparison to the last gen , but the reduction of 7 mics to 4 is clearly recognizable. Another thing is while it's playing something ( musics , news or simply voice feedback) it fails to pickup any command. You may shout ""Alexa"" and it still won't listen to you until you are as close as 1 inch away from it or press the Alexa command button. That is very disappointing and kills the basic notion of handsfree smart speaker"
Bharat Sharma,4,India,29-10-2020,FALSE,0,Overall good for above 10 years children not for above 30 years.,I like the sound clarity with Alexa interaction but Alexa most of the things and questions didn't identify and she is not known about the questions. That is the minus point here. I saw Google Assistant is better than the Alexa because Google can make the call to your contacts but Alexa is only for those people who installed the Alexa Application on their phone.
rakesh,3,India,13-07-2021,FALSE,1,"100% for English, hindi and <60%useful for south Indian languages",Not even 60% fit for south Indians even after adding tamil skills..most of the tamil or telegu songs it is unable to understand. Best options for training kids with english rhymes or songs.

Bhalchandra jadhav,4,India,04-01-2020,FALSE,0,Very good product....,"It's a very good product but when asked to play songs of Hindi movies or singers it plays Very different songs or the songs that have been sung by those in Karaoke apps. Some slight improvement has been seen of late.Also while answering questions about places , distances etc. it fails Many times."
Anshu,1,India,02-12-2020,FALSE,1,bad,when I setup echo dot after 2 hours it told sorry I have trouble understanding right now please try a little later i tried after 2 hours it was not fixed and then I replaced the item and again after 2 hours then told the same thing and again I waited but it was not fixed then i baught google nest mini it was working
RAJAGOPAL,5,India,02-09-2020,FALSE,0,Good hardware but poor software,"Its one of the finest smart speaker in indian market nd amazon prime 999rs per year subscription gives more benefits with music, video,etc When it comes to hardware it hav good sound which fills one smal room. Echo support more smart accessories thn google home nd apple homepod thats big thumbs up for Echo👍🏼 When it comes to software its lacks so much features. Google home ll give you more accurate answers and follw up conservation. Alexa properly dnt deals with follow up multiple questions. Amazon music dnt have more collections lik spotify, wynk. So overall good hardware with poor software. Needs to improve more in software. You need to plug in al the time because it does not come with battery option."
Sam Sam,5,India,19-10-2020,FALSE,0,Superb and convenient.,Superb product. Easy to setup and so convenient to use. I've set it up to link to my Spotify account so you get even a larger database if music with Prime music and Spotify combined.The sound quality surprised me. I have many other portable speakers but this one is one of the better ones.GO FOR IT.
prasanna jha,3,India,12-08-2019,FALSE,1,Sound quality is not as expected,"I am writing for this product because i returned it. I usually never return any product but i had a bad experience with this Eco Dot 3.Sound quality was not as expected and even Alexa voice command not recognized but it during playing song on it max volume. Sound was cracking, that's why i returned it."
Varun Malhotra,2,India,07-08-2020,FALSE,0,Do not recommend,"Most of the times response is ""Sorry i don't know"". To play video you need to add akill, to play audio you need to add skillto play movies you need to add skill. I mean seriously? Is Amazon so dumb that they want user to add all those skills manually instead of adding them by default?It cannot connect to smart tv, poor voice recognition, you literally have to shout so that she can here it. If you say ""Alexa play nursery rhymes on Youtube on fire tv"" it will say I don't know what is YouTube. WTH Man!"
Gaurav Raheja,5,India,31-01-2022,FALSE,0,Must have for Music.,We have been using Echo dot for playing Music with Kids around. It becomes easier to play songs without have to look out for the Phone. So less screen time in front of Kids and more family time.Speaker volume is good for hall. Good for in-house get-together.

Sunil Singh,2,India,29-09-2020,FALSE,0,Not responding as it was after 6 months,My Echo has stopped responding as it used to. Now you have to repeat couple of times to get the desire response at times it is quite frustrating..Sound has also decrease.. I was glad that I was contacted by amazon and replacement was scheduled. Return was picked up on 30th Sept. Since then I am following up with customer care and I have been telling that it will be dispatched within 24 hrs. I still see the same status (Item is not yet been dispatched) for order. Can someone please response with some concrete response?? I also wrote email to customer care but no response there..
Smitha Manoj,5,India,18-08-2021,FALSE,0,Awesome in every aspect except the playlist,"Voice recognition, response etc are flawless except that it picks up same annoying songs again and again. You cannot instruct Alexa to dislike an artist or stop playing particular song. In my case whenever the command is "" Alexa play songs"" it goes like "" playlist you may like- best of Arijit Singh- there is no change in the song and the order of songs too' . No option to do it manually through Alexa app too. Fortunately I have linked my Apple music through Alexa app and am happy with the song results now. Speaker output is good till volume 6 after that there's shrill."
Anand Bhide,4,India,10-05-2019,FALSE,0,"Good product, needs improvement",The Bluetooth speaker does its job really well. Sound quality is also excellent. But algorithm for Alexa is not up to the mark as yet. Especially when you ask her to play regional songs or Hindi songs. Also it does not ask you which search engine to use or which news you are interested in. It needs lot of improvement.
Deepak Ji,1,India,29-11-2019,FALSE,2,Please dont buy it,Simply the worseee device when it comes to connecting to internet....in the world where every things seems to pull off easily with the help of internet ..trust me instead of making things easier for you alexa devices especially amazon echo dot makes things ostentatiously difficult for you ....a sheer wastage of time.... stay away from it
Vk,5,India,16-07-2019,FALSE,0,Welcome home Alexa.,Today we bought Eco dot anf brought Alexa to our family...we are continuously talking to alexa from last 5 hrs and dont want to sleep and keep talling its such a amazing product to have. Sound quality is great..sound recognition is awesome...we enjoyed with alexa in living room at day and now she is making us sleep...it has everything for kids and adults....soothing flute music...relaxation songs...it can help u doing excercise. It takes off your load of remembering things..just tell alexa..she will do for u. Amazing product...thanks amazon and thanls alexa. Welxome home...Bluetooth connectivity has some issur but will sort that out ..anyway if u have wifi at home then u dont need bluetooth...one should definitely buy it. I give 10 out 10 to Alexa
Deepak,4,India,07-10-2019,FALSE,0,Good hardware. Software leaves much to be desired.,"I have both Google Home and Alexa.Alexa works better with smart devices. It responds much quicker to requests on turning light on/off compared to GHome, which clearly lags.However, Alexa lags GHome on answering questions and playing music. When asked to play music, it frequently responds with ""Saavn is not available in your region"" while playing Saavn other times. Also it's response to natural language questions is behind GHome.Speaker quality great. Speaker sensitivity excellent-it catches the wake word even when spoken from a distance. GHome lags here."
Varun Bhoopalam,5,India,14-06-2019,FALSE,0,Best Portable Assisstant,"Loved my purchase and the price at which it came was even more delightful. Need to add lots of skills but works quite fine with the pre-loaded skills. Sound clarity is awesome. I'm using Alexa in my office cabin to listen to my daily prayers and other songs. Appreciate it's understanding of my voice and reacting quite well to my requirements.If you are a prime user and looking for a product something like this, i bet you can't get any other in this price."
User,4,India,16-06-2021,FALSE,1,Good just as a bluetooth speaker,When you already have google assisatant voice recognition shouldn't be much of a deal. Alexa needs to be plugged in and conected to a wifi network to function as alexa! If no wifi it acts as a bluetooth speaker. The sound qualitu is pretty good other than alexa being alexa isnt as much fun as you think it is :)
Mrinal Das,5,India,19-03-2020,FALSE,0,"Alexa, I am Impressed 😄👍🔥🙏","Excellent device! After Fire TV Stick this is my 2nd Amazon made smart device & it once again surprises me. Sound quality is good enough. Voice recognition also works great. Only drawback is there is no Spotify integration, So I have to depend on Amazon Music/Jiosaavan which are both crap. Except that it's a great smart little device through which you can elaborate your smart life quite amazingly."
Soorya,3,India,01-03-2020,FALSE,0,Need Language improvement,"It would be great if it can communicate using other Asian and European languages.Sometimes when I ask to play music, it will start all over from the radio DJ comments. And keeps playing the same music.Doesn't know much about books in other language. I thought it can help me with my studies of other languages such as German and asked to read me a German book, but it doesn't know it.When it comes to music also it doesn't know any other language music. Need improvement in that area as well."
Abhijit Dandekar,5,India,21-10-2018,FALSE,2,Great product. I am a fan.,"This is the second Amazon Echo Dot I purchased within six months. I am very happy with the first one which is second generation model. This is bought for gifting purpose. The MRP is increased too much within six months, but I paid the ols price due to Great Indian Festival discount. At the price point of rupees 3000 it is a great bargain."
Blogger,3,India,09-09-2020,FALSE,0,Scope for improvement,"Writing the review after using it for one month.If you are fond of music, Amazon music collection is not vast. You cannot create your own playlist by uploading your own collection of songs in Amazon music yet. Hence, giving it three stars. When it comes to voice recognition, I realized Alexa can recognise whoever gives a command. This is not something great especially when you want Alexa device to only recognise your commands and nobody else's. Hence, three stars again. Everything else is good."
Harsha v,5,India,11-09-2020,FALSE,0,100%buy,"You whisper it whisper backs and the sound quality is just incredible and gets really really loud and voice recognition is best there is better than siri but can improve.and the amount of things you can do with it is incredible. Morning routine,evening routine,alarms,reminders, just seamless. All this provided you have stable wifi."
Ramesh Adhavaraju,5,India,09-11-2021,FALSE,0,"Good product, value for money","Product is good, after using for a month, felt bad, I should have gone to 4th generation, few features are missing in it, just a suggestion should have added micro sd features too, to listen for some downloaded songs also. All features are good and working well, HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT."
Raj Dabburi,5,India,25-01-2019,FALSE,0,"Wow, amazing friend we gained","Alexa is awesome, more than utility, it is good entertainment, almost like a new friend in your home. And as a child, you have to train her but results are great.Only issue is non compatibility with Google maps and lack of battery to carry in car or anywhere"
ArunSundar,5,India,18-10-2020,FALSE,1,Wonderful gadget,Echo dot this is awesome. Very happy 😊1. Its speaking2. It's very kind3. Telling information and what's today weatherAlso my daughter love alexa because it speaks 👌And it plays music and indian songs 😊We are very glad that it speaks and moreThanks to amazon 👌
Amazon Customer,1,India,15-07-2020,FALSE,1,Waste product without a battery in always needs a power plug with 0 portability,Waste product as it doesn't come with a baterry so it needs always a plug point to be connected. Basically it can be used only in home and not outdoor. In today's portable live this is a waste of purchase and doesn't solve any purpose without portability
Amazon customer,4,India,08-11-2021,FALSE,0,Very nice device,"I am writing this review after a month of usage.Pros-1. Sound Quality2. Easy integration with smart devices3. Amazing software4. Understands English and Hindi (might be supporting many more, but I have checked with only Hindi and English)Cons-1. If placed near tv and if tv volume is on, then it takes multiple attempts to listen to voice commands.2. It responds to everyone. Even if my tv says Alexa it starts listening and responds/act on it."
Basant Jain,4,India,06-04-2019,FALSE,0,Alexa Echo the friendly Dot,"I had seen a bigger version of Alexa at my sister’s home and was mighty impressed. I bought Dot only for a lark, just to be able to see if it works as good. My nephew set it up for me. It is a smaller version but works as good. It does have a shorter range but for a room space it’s great and not in your face product. Now the only litmus test it has to pass once I take it back to the middle east and see if it works as flawlessly as it did in India."
Dr.Amit,3,India,10-09-2019,FALSE,0,After buying echo dot you will purchase google home.,Most important thing is that Google home is like Android phone you can install any software and Amazon echo dot is like apple you will pay for heavy installation charges. Alexa didn't do anything without help of other software.Sometimes I feel amazon made echo dot to promote amazon prime membership customer.so if you want to use Alexa you will purchase Amazon Prime membership and many more so so be ready for investing more money to Alexa after buying Alexa.ONE MORE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOGLE HOME AND ECHO DOT IS LANGUAGE.GOOGLE CAN SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND HINDI PERFECTLY AND ECHO DOT UNDERSTAND ONLY ENGLISH.
Dakos,4,India,02-02-2021,FALSE,1,Good price but functionality doesn't always work,"Echo dot has many problems still..It often fails to connect to internet, if you intend to use two or more echo devices together as a stereo connection..then it will almost never work. Hindi AI needs some improvement.. It's a great buy for what it costs you but still leaves you wanting so much more which it is capable of."
Brijesh Maurya,3,India,01-07-2021,FALSE,1,"Dont expect it to do wonders, its needs a other 10 yrs of work","Well, good for kids but for the most part AI needs huge amount of work, dont expect smartness like google, it more of bluetooth speaker and there are better options available in this price range. My daughter likes to play around with Alexa with all kinds of unusual questions. Decided to keep it"
Mr.Sunil,5,India,04-12-2019,FALSE,0,MIND BLOWING,"Had problem for 1st time in connectivity but once it is connected it gets auto connected. Sound Quality could have been more good, it has great sound but the bass is not up to the mark. U are given a rubber base so that it doesn't vibrate much. Alexa can hear and recognise my voice very easily Its friendly n Hindi is enabled. There are lots of things u can try. Jokes , News , Music are very easy to listen..Just Say ""Alexa..."".I am SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT!!I got it for 1999/- with Wipro Bulb in offer."
Arpan,2,India,22-10-2021,FALSE,1,echo dot 3rd gen experience is not good so far,"Twice it happened to me that the echo dot device got unresponsive everyone we reser the WiFi router. The device is unable to access the Internet connection. Tried every possible way, even considering ntacted the customer service. Still the problem was not solved. Another annoying thing is the replaced item is not new one rather refurbished."
Nikhil Choudhary,5,India,03-02-2021,FALSE,0,Awesome Life companion,"Now having used Amazon's Echo products for over 6 months, I sincerely feel that it's becoming increasingly difficult to survive without it in my day-to-day life. Awesome product by Amazon. Kudos to this phenomenal creation."
Jogender Singh Sehrawat,5,India,21-11-2020,FALSE,0,ITS AMAZINGLY SIMPLE AND MOST EFFECTIVE PRODUCT,"Its an extremely user friendly and great device. It just enhance your productivity, very effective to break procrastination tendencies. It does much more than I thought , it will do. I strongly recommend that if you have a little money to spare , its totally worth. Amazingly simple integration and wonderful little device. Thank you Amazon"
Ashish Pednekar,5,India,18-07-2019,FALSE,0,Y buy a speaker when u can get smart speaker,Man this product is the best..we get just a speaker at 2500 sometimes more than that but I got a smart speaker with a led bulb..sound quality is superb voice recognition is good and Alexa support is the best..can answer almost all questions..doesn't take too long to respond..can control all the smart electronics with the help of alexa..happy me
Saswat David,5,India,21-02-2020,FALSE,0,Thoroughly Satisfied,"I'm very thoroughly satisfied with the Echo Dot. For a low price not only does it work as a speaker, but it makes your life easier - you don't have to manually look for songs, can use it to control lighting if you have a smart bulb (another good purchase), use it as a clock, an alarm, or just to listen to a joke when you're bored. You can also set custom voice commands to personalize your room.The only negative I think is that since it needs to be plugged in into a socket, it's not portable; which is why you might want to buy another speaker."
Lokanna,5,India,21-11-2018,FALSE,0,Think once while buying this kk,Hii friends i am writing this review after the use of 1 week this amazon echo dot this device design is ossom and it is very good.The sound of this device is very ossom but while buying these type of devices first check the features and when you are having the supporting smart devices in your home and if u don't have any smart devices don't buy this this is useful to listen songs and to listen news and etc but for only music this is worth less the connection of the schoot is worst it should be connected anytime for wifi and electricity and after using for 2 days only this is getting struck while playing songs and again it is useful for keeping remainders and alarms etc but the connecting skills is bad and the voice recognisation is ok it says another one while we are saying another one if we ask something it answers another one in sometimes so my dear friends think ones while buying this all will keep reviews but some are useful and some are not useful if u think this is useful hit like bye
surya,4,India,23-07-2019,FALSE,0,NICE product,I have eco dot 2 i was buy 3rd i have google mini too1 . nice sound quality2. Far batter then google home mini3. sound is warm4. quick response5. led light niceconsmissing sound when you speak hey alexa 2nd gen gives sound but new one not give sound notificationconclusion its far batter than google home mini google home mini some times irritating alexa like girls google mini like boys 😁amazon is developing nice they have good quality but google is new they dont know sound quality
RAVITEJA PEMMARAJU,5,India,09-01-2019,FALSE,0,Worth buying,"I loved it to the core. Though Google home has more features than Echo. I love these AI stuff. Lot of improvements were done over previous 2.0 gen. Sound clarity is simply super. But only backdrop is that , Alexa doesnt understand most of our conversation. Waiting for next firmware update"
Balaaa,1,India,08-02-2019,FALSE,1,Echo Dot - big disappointment,Good sound but disappointed.This device decides whether i should listen to Spotify or not. Probably Alexa thinks it can really cause a war.fails as a Bluetooth speaker.Not getting updates as expected. Yet to get Hindi language on it although I got to know if the update couple of months back. There are regional constraints on some features and some shows as connecting to smart TVs but don't work.Also the first product had a bug and I had to get it replaced.I should rather have donated my money.
Aarthi Gurunathan,4,India,24-07-2019,FALSE,0,Good for entertaining kids...,"Got this on sale in Prime day for 2500 with a Syska Smart Light.... for this price I would say it's a steal deal... pretty good... recognizes voice from long distances... plays required music... good for reminders and alarms... kids love it... helps in play, pause, stop movies in Fire TV and YouTube, however cannot navigate. but still needs lots of improvement in terms of web search options... on the whole for me it's good."
Your Average Indian Girl,5,India,11-01-2021,FALSE,0,Mom LOVES this!,"She listens to Vishnu Sahasranamam and Suprabhatam everyday. While cooking and doing house work, she loves that she just has to say ""Alexa, play Vishnu Sahasranamam"". Great product for ease of use and quality of voice output"
Nick,4,India,30-09-2019,FALSE,0,Few changes can improve overall experience.,"It needs a lot of improvements, we can not play songs directly from mobile to the echo dot, we can not browse songs through the apps( Gaana, saavn, prime music) and it only accepts voice commands for playing music. It would be better if we can type the song to be played as it doesn't recognize a lot of songs through voice commands. Needs high speed Internet to function properly. It does not recognize voice commands when a song is playing, so we can't mute it while a song is playing. Despite all these cons, it is still a pretty handy product."
Amazon Customer,1,India,18-10-2021,FALSE,0,This is one of the worst voice assistant ever along with Bixby,"The Alexa voice assistant will never understand the commands you say. Don’t ever buy this the only reason it is promoted here is because of Amazon. I have a Google home as well, and looking at how well it performs at the same tasks. This here is Jeff Bezos turd. My review is applicable for all Alexa devices."
Nikhil Shrivastava,4,India,08-01-2021,FALSE,0,BUYING ALEXA IS ONE OF THE MOST NICE DECISION I MADE IN 2020,"Alexa is great. For a bedroom or a living room, Alexa works like magic. I also got a light (Wifi enabled) from wipro along with Alexa as a package and it had works wonder for us.It understands Hindi, English and also talks with us when we are alone or lonely.You can also connect Alexa with your mobile using it as a Bluetooth speaker. It's a true fact that this version has to be plugged in all the time- but apart from this- its just GREAT! I loved it and a true fan of ALEXA!"

Techcrew,5,India,18-12-2018,FALSE,0,Ultimate Product and Essential Member of Home,Echo Dot is great product and now it is essential member of my home. It react just like my pet and always ready to fulfill my desire of information on just voice command. Best product for kids as they enjoy most while talking with Alexa... Superb product and Must have in Home. :) :) :)
V I,4,India,25-02-2021,FALSE,0,Alexa is good but can be better !,Alexa is my favorite and I have 3 of them ! But this one I bought as gift for my in-laws and had trouble setting up their voice recognition and Alexa Integration at their home because they did not have an Amazon Prime account!!🙏
Amazon Customer,5,India,01-02-2021,FALSE,0,"A beautiful product by Amazon, thanks Amazon!!!","I like this product very very much. But only one thing I dislike that's why this product was not lunched in our generation I mean some 25 yrs earlier. So we can enjoy it on those days. Any way ,now I am enjoying it like never before."
shobith muraleedharan,3,India,02-02-2022,FALSE,0,The casting with amazon music is not proper,When we cast amazon music with exhi it recognises only straight forward songs. No podcast or stations are played in echo. And it even does not recognise podcast through voice. The alexa app is also too slow Better to go for google
Sukanya Thakur,1,India,11-10-2020,FALSE,2,DO NOT BUY,Are you a lonely person? Do you need someone to talk to? If yes go for it. If not DON'T BUY IT. Unless you want to be like Alexa Play this song and want to hear Sorry infinite number of times.. Please buy any other cheap bluetooth speaker because she won't get connected unless you have a wifi and plus even with wifi she is not worth it.
Abhijit H,3,India,06-11-2019,FALSE,0,"OK, Still need to improve on different different apps,skills and languages integration","Still need to improve on different different apps,skills and languages integration, sound/songs quality gets flat if increase volume. Sometimes wont catch up voice commands even if we speaks in neutral English or Hindi languages."
Ankit Vaidya,4,India,20-09-2021,FALSE,0,Good for Alexa talk not mainly for music,"Ya i like it's very much but my point of view is it's bit expensive to buy it for those planning to listen music it serves best with talking to alexa and AI stuff but when you listen music or just watch movie in laptop connected to it's not upto the mark you will get disappointed but for AI it's good ,may be its next gen have enough bass and sound for songs but definitely not this one , this one has more crisp voice which is very good while talking with alexa."
Joshi,4,India,31-08-2020,FALSE,0,owsm,in this price segment normal bluetooth speak cost almost similar costthis is owsmi bought this in lockdown and really helpful to not feel isolatedsometimes it's miss our command andwhenever first time i am give command to play song it missed it missed continuously until i pronounced 10 timesrest about the speaker is best
Gourav,1,India,30-07-2019,FALSE,2,Not that great anymore!,Has stopped working in the 2nd Month itself. Doesn't do what it is supposed to do. I've to repeat 3-4 times and even then it doesn't function properly.Worked just fine for 2 months and then suddenly it can't recognize when I call for it. Weird.
P.sanyasi r.,4,India,04-11-2020,FALSE,0,A great deal and nice product from amazon,"It been a 2 weeks or more than I am using it, for me it was a great deal for buying echo dot,Pro:1.great audio2.Instant configuration while turning on3.A great A.I for time passCons:1.sometimes it feels like laggy,even no one is connects your wifi2.after using a week I find that voice recognition is little slow3.They need to update their software with more features"
Gaurav,5,India,15-11-2018,FALSE,0,A great addition,Having ordered 3 echo dot and one echo i would say Alexa is a happy change in out daily routine especially music. Earlier I had to search for different types of songs and my mother couldn't do it by herself. With echo dot and alexa it is like a breeze and anyone can play music of their choice and do other activities without any dependence. Even my kids use it.The sound quality is also quite good. A must buy product.
Pratyush,4,India,06-07-2021,FALSE,0,Good device to possess,"Playing music, knowing about weather or latest news, setting reminders etc have never been easier. My kid is a big Alexa fan and keeps interacting with the echo dot. Clearly it's very easy to use. Though, it was a bit difficult to connect with the OnePlus TV. Some basic TV functions can be performed but there is lot more required. The next generation devices will probably have more advance features."
Vimit Panchal,3,India,20-10-2020,FALSE,0,Bass is high so sound clarity decreases with decrease in treble.,"This is a very good product that amazon has come up with. Hats off to them. It is fun talking to alexa. Alexa provides us our day to day information. Though a few upgradations are also required for alexa software.There is just one drawback of this product that in sound quality, there is improper balance between bass and treble. Bass is a lot more as compared to treble so speech clarity decreases with decrease in treble.I hope upcoming echo gen are made keeping everything in mind."
Anshul Gupta,5,India,02-10-2019,FALSE,0,I love Alexa !,"I have been using this product for 3 days now and this is the best smart Bluetooth speaker i have ever come across. The only con i and most people would feel that it has to be plugged in all the time for the use, probably in the future it will come with a chargable battery. Looking forward for that."
Ram,5,India,29-01-2021,FALSE,0,Good product.,I was using google all along. Bought alexa for a variant. 3rd gen is good. Bass and treble are very nice in that product range. Overall loved the product. Got the product after one week of struggle and follow up with amazon. A very bitter experience in the last 8 years of mydealing with Amazon.
karthic,1,India,20-11-2021,FALSE,0,Sound quality is worst.,"Didn't like the sound quality, it's very hard to hear what Alexa speaks. Tried every settings, nothing worked.I now love my Google home more, such a sharp sound for any room. Amazon could have focused on the speakers quality."
ARUN KUMAR,2,India,10-07-2020,FALSE,0,Honest review after using it for 5 days,You will enjoy it for few days in starting after few days you feel waste of money. You have to scream like mad when echo Dot is at volume 8 or more. I am using it with wipro smart bulb. It will increase your electricity bill for sure by 200-300 if you keep it always on. Better to avoid it.
Jay,5,India,05-02-2021,FALSE,1,Go for it without a doubt,"Alexa has the most authentic voice in smart speakers. Speaks Hindi wayyy fluently than Google Assistant.There are thousands of skills available on Alexa App. However if the developer did a bad job, don't blame Alexa for it!"
Devendra,5,India,05-09-2021,FALSE,1,Great product 3rd for me,Absolutely great product comes pre linked to your account if you select.Seamless integration and easy install.Using 3 now at my home.
Rajkumar,5,India,10-08-2019,FALSE,0,Smart Speaker with Best Deal,I received at a very good price with a combo of amazon fire tv stick and Wipro smart bulb under 5 kI think this is the best deal for meoverall sound quality is very good.Bluetooth connectivity is very fastAlexa app is a bit slow to install skills but everything is good for usability.now am waiting for Alexa to speak Hindi
Mayur K.,4,India,22-10-2020,FALSE,0,Best device with few cons,Device is very good. Sometime they confuse about the similar word like if I ask one song and if that song has same words of some other song then Alexa will play any song. Other issue I found that Ji Saavn songs not played on Alexa. I don't know the reason. In case if we ask to tell story then Alexa says you have nothing in Kindle app. Or sometimes ask many things need to be purchased. Anyone has faced issues can you tell me solution. Atleast i want know how to connect jio saavn songs to Alexa
Vinay Prajapati,1,India,09-09-2021,FALSE,1,Of no usage,You can rely on it as much as you want but later you will realize speaking up takes more efforts than just doing the task :P
ajay joshi,5,India,13-11-2019,FALSE,0,Worth Each Penny! Moms best friend Alexa.,"Best 👍💯 AI ever used!Sound quality is damn cool!I order alexa from my hall to bedroom yet she listen (don't judge I have big area)Most favorite part is, before ordering it my mom thought it's waste of money and now she talk with her more than she talks with me.I ordered alexa in diwali sale, I received it along with smart wifi bulb 💡 which makes it more interesting. Now I am looking to buy more smart stuff to connect with alexa."
Punit,5,India,09-01-2022,FALSE,0,Absolutely amazing AI product,This product is awesome. It recognizes what song you want to hear and plays it immediately from its vast library. Voice recognition is great. It can hear u from a distance even when songs are playing. I am loving it.
Vinid,5,India,16-01-2019,FALSE,0,Right design Great sound,As an owner of the echo dot second generation and the Google Home mini... I would tell that I an a fan of the echo dot 3rd generation.. The design is great and sturdy with good quality speakers which deliver great sound. The sensitivity of the mic is also superb.. Thanks to the 4 built in mics..The only downside which I found was the adapter which was not a micro USB.. But can't complain as the speakers need extra juice which cannot be delivered by a micro USB.. (maybe)..Anyway overall it was a great buy..
sumith,5,India,10-08-2020,FALSE,0,Excellent smart speaker,Echod dot is an excellent smart speaker which feels very useful. Got it for 2299 with wipro smartbulb in prime day sale and its a good deal. Voice recognition is good enough and speaker sound quality is as good as can be expected at this size.. over-all a high quality product from amazon
Alex Anthony,5,India,20-11-2018,FALSE,0,Simply Amazing,"Awesome Product, I already had Amazon Echo Plus in my bedroom and was looking for the new generation Echo Dot for the living room. Now there is music and games being played all around the house. This new Echo Dot is simply best, with awesome speaker and it feels surround sound experience. Just go for it and you will never feel bored."
dipankar basumatary,5,India,20-08-2020,FALSE,0,Awsome!,"I must say very great product. I got this product on prime sell @2200. If u want that everything should work on your voice command than just go for it. It has very nice voice recognition even if you are far away. Everything works perfectly like playing music, news etc. But if u have bad internet plz don't buy."
Akhilesh,5,India,12-11-2019,FALSE,0,Value for money.,I bought the device when it was on sale. Just Rs.2050 A perfect start for a perfect smart home. Very good voice feedbacK. Sound quality is okay for a single room. But what can you Expect from a tiny speaker. It catches and here’s your voice even from the very far almost 15-20 feet. If you are in the room just talk in your normal pitch and sound and the Alexa will hear you. I am very impressed and happy after buying this product. People interested in smart home should definitely go for it.
Harish Kumar,4,India,15-10-2019,FALSE,0,Good but need some AI improvements,"As a speaker, it has a very good loudness and I got it for only ₹1,999 which is a very good price for this type of speaker. Sound quality is very good and crystal clear.But as a smart speaker it need a lot of improvements. Sometimes it doesn't understand very simple questions and sentences. Sometimes it will not play the song you are telling it to play, it plays a song with similar name. Sometimes you will need to tell song's singer, and movie etc to play songs, which according to me ruins the experience.It need a lot of AI improvements. If you are looking for a very smart speaker then go for Google Home mini or Google Home. It will not satisfy you as a AI but it has better sound quality then Google home mini and it connects with a lot of smart devices which google home mini can't. The choice is yours.Good Speaker :- Echo DotGood AI :- Google Home mini"

IT looks dope tooAn Excellent buy. Really Satisfied ."

Go Through The Full Review To Know How 😍,"The media could not be loaded.  Thanks to Amazon for this amazing product at an amazing Price in this Great Indian Festival: I was lucky to get this Echo Dot bundled with Wipro smart bulb @1999 !Now the important thing : How to be able to use it in Hindi . First go and check the software version of ur echo dot from ur Alexa App in the smartphone ( go to the 'Device' menu at the down right corner in the app). I have uploaded the pic of the updated software version till today 07.10.2019. Just command echo dot "" check for software updates"" . Echo dot will start updating ur software for a little time.Wait until a blue ring appears in ur echo dot. Don't prompt anything to the echo device during the update.After the update u can set the device language to Hindi (India) in ur device settings.I have uploaded a small video to show that it is really working smoothly.Hope this review will be helpful to people who wants to use it in Hindi like me."
Mohammad Wasim Akram,2,India,17-10-2019,FALSE,0,Prefer Google assistant than alexa,"It's a waste guys.Settings are very complex.Cannot able to connect as a Bluetooth speaker to my mobile.If I say Alexa play tollywood songs it plays Bollywood songsNo matter what it won't able to understand your commands in indian accemts.Sound quality is very good and 4 inbuilt far field mic s are useless because I will not catch your voice from 2 metre distance also.have to shout loud.Either it understands Hindi or English bases upon settings, not bilingual.Anyhow I got it for 1657 approx.Would prefer Google assistant"
JS,3,India,08-11-2021,FALSE,0,Average sound,You will mostly use it to listen to music and that is one thing where this amart speaker really needs to improve. It is very very loud but what is lacks is clarity. You will have to connect it a better speaker using Bluetooth.
Amandeep S.,5,India,07-11-2020,FALSE,0,Alexa with smart wifi device,"Its amazing syncs well with wifi lamp.

Mani,5,India,14-09-2019,FALSE,0,I love this echo dot,Echo dot is really a very powerful device in a small package. It works almost perfectly with Alexa. You juts need to understand and customize the app according to your region. The voice quality and sound is awesome.
DIWAKAR V,5,India,02-06-2019,FALSE,0,Excellent Voice recognition. Good for home automation,Great sound quality. Excellent recognition of commands. Voice calling and messaging needs to be introduced in India. Why amazon not provides inbuilt battery for these devices?

Amazon Customer,3,India,06-10-2021,FALSE,0,Expectation not reached,Expected more from this product like we can use at any place if we have internet but it won't work in that way because it doesn't have battery we should plug all the time to socket and also it don't have option to connect different internet connections automatically.I understood that it will useful for listening music and to ask regular queries.Music also it will play all the time from our playlist.Especially we have to use this product only at home
Jasmeet,3,India,19-06-2019,FALSE,0,Average next generation Smart BT Speaker,"you can use ECHO DOT for daily routine, alarms, reminders, to-do list and many more things but there are many limitations also like you can't connect ECHO DOT with your Mobile device for calling.

Rahul Gautam,2,India,21-06-2020,FALSE,0,Absolutely horrifying experience,"Extremely bad experience with Amazon- Bought this with in combo with fire tv stick and Wipro bulb for 7098 rs. My three previous fire sticks were all for 2600rs during sale instead of 4000rs. This time I was willing to pay 4000 for the stick as echo dot I was getting for 3029 and Wipro bulb for like 100 bucks (699rs otherwise).- Echo dot ran fine for first 3-4 days then I faced mic issues a few times. I felt could be because of other noises, ceiling fan perhaps.- I then tried to run specific lists e.g. I went to Amazon music app, saw the playlist I wanted to play. I asked echo dot to play that list from Amazon music. Instead it kept playing random playlists and a few times it mentioned it didn't recognise that list even though it was right there in front of me on the phone.- I emailed cs for above issue, no response till date. Been 7 days.- As a workaround, I decided to play music from app rather and then cast it on Echo Dot. It kept showing connecting (blue circle kept rolling) but nothing ever happened. Means cast option also didn't work. Being a techie myself, I performed all tech articles from Google, reset device etc., Checked location, what not. Finally, I rang cs and they perfomed a few troubleshooting which didn't work. They informed I would be contacted in 24-48 hours. I mentioned replacement window ends after 48 hours and I want response by then. Wasn't too keen in going for replacement and trouble people so agreed to wait for 48 hours window.- to my surprise, it's been 3 days now, no response. I called cs. Was asked to wait for 48 more hours. I asked for supervisor. He came on call and asked me to wait for his team to perform troubleshooting. I had lost it by then. I asked for replacement and after huge hold and verbal discussions to and fro, supervisor agreed for replacement. But informed I'd be informed in a few hours.- I checked now, I am being issued refund and it cost me 500 rs setback. Whole logic of bundle and save money was absolutely rubbish and Amazon support really destroyed the overall experience.- Having bought items worth in lacs, I wonder if it was all worth it."
Kippy,5,India,04-12-2020,FALSE,0,Best companion ....I believe alexa ismay soulmate,Alexa has become my best buddy... loved all the games and music I am able to use with this device.

Amazozon,4,India,30-06-2019,FALSE,0,Good buy,"Good for the price. Alexa isn't like Google when responding to questions, and that can be improved. A good hand less when having children and toddlers around. Doesn't respond well at times. Maybe because the jio internet is bad right now in my location at night hours."
Ajit,5,India,18-10-2020,FALSE,0,lovely and amazing experience.......,"It's my first alexa echo dot. After receiving I wondered why I didn't ordered it before.

SAHIL ,4,India,31-10-2018,FALSE,0,My opinions about echo dot 3,I think this device is pretty excellent. Responses quickly and shortly to the question. As well as contain a thousand of skill with respect to different categories. Device is excellent but since there are many drawbacks regarding local activities. About voice mic cannot hear sounds from the distance it has to be shouted which looks pretty embarrassing device mic quality should be improved and the most important thing. I don't know why sometimes it doesn't respond hence if I am near but then also it doesn't. Responses that's the matter I am giving it 4 star otherwise it's an intelligent device design for any place......but must come with charging battery ....
Aashish Razdan,5,India,23-07-2019,FALSE,0,Couldnt have asked more,"After much deliberation and having two google assistant homes (Regular + MIni) at home, ordered for Alexa and it has not disappointed. Superior sound quality than the google mini, notification of products purchased from Amazon and seamless Bluetooth connectivity with a larger speaker is unmatched. Also, the microphones are awesome as I had been facing problems with voice commands on google when the speaker is playing music at top volume."
RAHUL MUKHERJEE,5,India,26-01-2019,FALSE,0,Small intelligence pack,"It has a good voice responsiveness along with a vast repository of information. Sound is awesome- good clarity and volume makes it a great speaker. Good build quality.The thing I found that needs to be worked on is its reach. Apart from the linked apps like Zomato or Ola, it cannot access other alternate apps like Swiggy or Uber or any other contemporaries. These searches should be made more flexible so as to search from other contemporary apps to give a better search result. Also I would really appreciate if echo can be paired with other devices through bluetooth or wifi."
Ryan,5,India,29-09-2019,FALSE,1,Worth a upgrade,"I am very happy with this device as it has made my life easier, feel good to upgrade. The Bluetooth connection is good and the mic is really as mentioned in the product description. In short its a must buy device and oh yes I got this device to connect with the TCL 55 P series tv. Will connect it and come review again"
Manish Kamble,4,India,31-10-2018,FALSE,1,Continuous power connection required,"There is one drawback that this device always needs to be wired to the power supply, which makes it difficult to carry outside. Alexa doesn't understand few words like, if you ask her to play a particular song then she will ask you to opt for prime membership whereas if you provide movie name or album name then she will play all the songs from the given movie/album."
Jestin Joy,2,India,15-04-2019,FALSE,0,Honest review after using it for 4 months,First of this is a smart speaker (atleast i thought it is) but i didn't find anything smart about this. Alex the infamous personal assistant amazon so furiously market about can't even understand half of the things. But when it comes to sound quality amazon beats all the smart speakers out there. But we can get a decent soundbar for the price if we just need that. Way to go Alexa..
Rajwinder S.,1,India,10-10-2020,FALSE,1,No Use,I thought i am buying something really useful and technologically upgraded but after using it i found its not of any use. Keep disconnecting and don't recognise voice most of the time . Already Setup so many times in almost 1 month .I don't know if its defective or it has some other issue. But for me its not that what i actually thought it is .
Raja,4,India,13-08-2020,FALSE,0,Not satisfied with software.  Upset with echo dot.,"Song selection can be based on language and application preferred. When say intend to hear a Tamil song like 'Play Muthu movie songs' it plays muthu Telugu songs. Mostly not play from Amazon music.so it is difficult to play our selection.when I say retro from 80s Tamil songs, it plays very old songs from 60s as alternatively.I bought the black one.the speaker outer looks dusty not as fresh peace."
Shirish Verma,5,India,08-10-2021,FALSE,0,Best in this price range,"I've been using it for 2 months now, working totally fine. Voice quality and volume is really great comparing with its size. Voice recognition is good. Doesn't work without wifi. Best for home use, bluetooth connectivity is seemless. If you love to listen music and use AI to schedule meetings, alarms, listen to news, this one is for you. It doesn't have a battery, runs only on electricity. In this price range, this is the best product"
Care queen,1,India,09-02-2022,FALSE,0,Not a fan,"Honestly not that great, not into the whole voice recording thing, would love to return it however the window is over.... The volume as an external speaker is not that great and it has to be plugged in to work"
Vishal Surani,1,India,17-07-2019,FALSE,2,They need to improve voice commands recognizaction,I am not happy with the product. 90% of time it doesn't recognize what you said even if the song is there on amazon Music. I purchased for my parents for listening old songs over voice commands. But this device never plays right music .
chandra,1,India,12-01-2022,FALSE,0,Spot on Artificial intelligence,"The device is completely dumb if internet connectivity is bad.It could have a memory where some of the information could be kept like storing song, story etc to play later.It should play a shorter command to signify disconectivity.Not a full length message' I am hha"
Bash,3,India,31-10-2018,FALSE,0,Not  as good as 2nd generation,"Have been using it for some days now . Sound quality is better but the response time , response and feedback are not as good and precise as the older model . Not very happy with this purchase . 2nd gen model way better than this one in terms of response to voice commands , visually displaying status etc ."
Rohit Justa,5,India,18-11-2018,FALSE,1,Amazing product one must have in it's own,I was waiting to have Alexa of mine own...when it arrived it was really great to operate. Connecting Alexa is not a kids job. But once it is done it's cool to have fun with it. Really good far field sensors. This is my first technology experience still its really great to have Alexa...I love when she can send and call to another Alexa free of charge also when sheep keep the remindersa and alrams. But I feel it consumes a little extra data 2 GB a day is sufficient for a user who want to enjoy aleaxa all 24 hours a day... Speaker quality and appereance are really awesome....
Fido,5,India,06-01-2021,FALSE,0,Brilliant as expected,"Amazing product to have in bedroom where you can use it mainly as a very good speaker to listen to music and then ofcourse to control your smart appliances, news, weather and the lot...Second Echo in the house after Echo Show."
KUNAL SINGH,5,India,26-08-2021,FALSE,0,Big wow for sound quality n voice command 😊,"Happy customer. Sound quality and voice command is amazingly good.

Coz it will sure work with other music apps, but you will not get the great collection of Amazon Music."
Panda Patético,5,India,22-03-2020,FALSE,1,Epic AI,The media could not be loaded.  I never used smart speakers before this was my first one and I'm writing this review after a year of usage.Alexa integration: almost every smart appliances has alexa integration in it so if you're looking for a epic smart speaker go with this oneVoice recognition: it doesn't often recognise my voice cause of my accent lolSound quality: i love the sound it produce from a small speaker.

RAM NIWAS SAINI,1,India,02-11-2019,FALSE,2,Need much more improvement in this product.,"Boaring after 2-3 days only.

Gov,5,India,04-07-2020,FALSE,0,First step towards the future.,"Works great! Though it doesn't make anything significantly easier, it's a nice addition to ones room and also a good starting point to experience the future.Audible Suno is a superb bonus to this product. And also most used music services like gaana and jio saavn are free to use, which makes this very useful.

Like if i wish to play specific album from Gana or Amazon music, it stick to play from Jio Savan and that is my horrible experience from Eco dot.Amazon team, pls fix such bugs and update else the customer reviews wont let you up."

Kranthi Kumar CH,4,India,05-10-2019,FALSE,0,Awesome Echo Dot,"This little Amazon Echo is the best one to start with a voice enabled voice assistant that can provide you with a range of information about many different things from news, weather, music, voice controlling compatible bulbs and fire TV stick all with this little Echo. Experience this to explore more that can be done with it."
sandeep,2,India,03-10-2019,FALSE,0,"Need a lot of improvements. Still not recognising voices, can't understand 80% commands",Just a decent piece. Not much appreciated. What worked perfectly is:1. How is weather2. When is sunset3.play music : mostly can't understand which music you said and will end up playing some random.4. Setup alarmsApart from that you can just use it as a speaker in a corner of your room.PS: still few features were quite good but as i said it can't understand commands at first attempt nor the second attempt. :P
Manish,1,India,05-05-2019,FALSE,3,Worst product experience from Amazon,Unable to understand any voice command. For any command it starts playing some english song. Worst thing is it not even take touch free voice command even from one feet distance. You need to touch the device always to enable Alexa.On top of the that it was ordered with a gift message. They simply send out the item no note or message. This one of the worst experience from Amazon till now.
Amazonholic,5,India,13-11-2018,FALSE,0,kids love it and elders adore it,ovely addition to the family. kid are having a gala time exploring it. best usage I have found till now is that it functions as a alarm clock waking you up with foot tapping or soulful music based on your choice. I wish Amazon adds more feature to it to make it as a inseparable gadget
Raja,3,India,22-10-2018,FALSE,1,Distortion Sound,Now this is the second time the speaker produced distortion sound while playing songs. But the cracking sound gone after restarting the device. Don't know whats causing that kind of sound. But I'm a bit worried. Is anybody having the same problem?update : now its the 3rd time.
sachin,4,India,18-08-2019,FALSE,0,Overall a good product but need lots of adaptation n improvement in india,"Impressive but less support for skills/apps in india...secondly, issues in recognizing indian english accent by alexa...overall good product in terms of music quality, bluetooth connectivity n integration with other other smart equipments but alexa needs improvement in terms of recognizing speech n skills in india..."
Vijay Simha,3,India,25-09-2020,FALSE,0,Smart alexa is missing some features,"I have odered Alexa with bit expectaion. Some important features are missing in it.1. It doesn't have battery. People can't use it so versatile2. It doesn't remind us when we keep reminder in a phone. Instead it just push notifies to the mobile3. it uses more wifi than what we expect4. Where ever we take the alexa we should give power, wifi , bluetooth.If amazon correct this drawbacks surely it would be the best A.I speaker"
Shreyas,5,India,22-11-2020,FALSE,0,Alexa is Best.. Wohoo,"Go for it guys. Integrating TV, ac and lights made things different at home. Also ask anything from nearby room also Alexa answers and play songs for my mom and news for Dad. And once you start adding new features it becomes more fun.Yes one thing you have to interact and it becomes better."
Sourabh gupta,4,India,24-07-2020,FALSE,0,Best assistant,"This is must buy product for those who loves music , has a busy schedule and live alone. I think ur heart don't need anyone if alexa is present with u.It's useful for every age groups. It understands hindi language very accurately nd this is the most lovable thing about alexa. It has a lot of qualities butI'm mentioning only cons depending upon situations:U need a broadband connection or any wifi device to fully utilize the features because it listen to u only when internet worksNd the second thing is 24hour power supply because there is no battery inside it.That's the only reason I returned it.Go for it n I'm sure you'll love it😊😍"
shahid ayaz,1,India,12-11-2019,FALSE,2,Fedup with Alexa Eco dot speaker 😐,"My expectations was very high when I bought Alexa Eco dot speaker.When I Say play song “gulabi ankhe ho teri Dekhi” it doesn’t understand and plays different song.Sometimes I have to shout on Alexa while giving the command to Alexa for playing song,bcz of software issue it does not listen in a one time.I am really fed up with Alexa speaker and I do not use it.Amazon I did not expect from you😡"
George Easaw,5,India,20-10-2021,FALSE,0,One of the best Amazon purchases,The media could not be loaded.  One of the best Amazon products I have ever purchased. And I have gifted the same to many friends. Simply superb. The AI based song selection tool is nothing but great ..
Randeep Chhabra,4,India,03-12-2020,FALSE,0,Good,"It is good but what I didn't like is that on the page Amazon is marketing that it integrates with Gaana, but that is not the case. It has no integration options for Gaana which is a disappointment for me as that is the primary app I use for songs and I brought Alexa majorly playing songs.For Rest all features, I'll update the review once I use it for sometime"
Kumar Kartikeya,4,India,24-10-2018,FALSE,0,Value for money,"Awesome product with improved sound quality but still some improvement is needed like woofer. Sometimes it gets confused in song selection and answers diffently or find difficulties in locating nearby places. I find Alexa very talkative and full with humor. Hope Amazon will look into it and it will be resolved/ improved. Nevertheless, it is value for money."
User,5,India,05-06-2020,FALSE,0,Completely Worth!!,I own my Echo-Dot for 5 months now and let me tell you ITS AMAZING. Alexa is an amazing voice assistant and The Speaker itself is also amazing with its crystal clear surround sound audio setup. It is very fun to play with and has LOTS AND LOTS OF apps and games and smart home features that you can find in the Alexa App. The speaker is soo intelligent that it can pay your electricity bills and network bills with it too. I totally recommend buying this smart-speaker.
Siddhant Bhutoria,1,India,04-10-2020,FALSE,2,A very stupid AI,"Not much use as the integrations are very limited. Would prefer to use a two way light switch over saying ""Alexa turn on lights"".plays good music but limited to few music streaming apps.The rival smart speakers seems to be a smarter choice.Alexa doesn't know how to play YouTube 😵"
y v saimadhav,5,India,01-01-2020,FALSE,0,So far So good,Set it up and started to command Alexa to do my bidding. Son and missus also love it. The sound quality surprised me coming from a small speaker. Tried to connect with a bluetooth speaker but not successful. There is a learning curve that must be tackled though. The test drive will go on for some more time. But so far so good.
ritika p.,1,India,15-08-2021,FALSE,1,Only one problem that should be wireless,That should be wireless. So that it can be easy to carry without a switch. Just because of wire it's so annoying.
Nidhi,5,India,08-08-2021,FALSE,0,"EASY TO USE, Sound quality great.","Alexa echo dot is an amazing product. The sound quality is top, very premium. It is very easy to use. Nothing like Bluetooth speakers where we have to turn on Bluetooth then connect device and all that. It’s very easy to use, just connect once and ask her anything to play or other things she can do. Alexa recognises the speech well. Once connected to the account, that phone containing the Alexa app does not need to be home or near. She can operate independently. Only need is wifi and electricity."
GV,2,India,22-12-2018,FALSE,0,"If you don't have Google home device, you'll like this.","I've a Google home mini, that's why maybe I'm disappointed with this product. I compared it by asking the same questions to mini, echo mostly said, I'm sorry. When I asked Google home, what is Om, it recognised and immediately said the relevant answer. Echo did not recognise, I then pronounced the alphabets, still it failed to help, I then asked what is AUM? Then it replied stating it's a terrorist organisation, and I thought I'd rather not ask it anything."
I M,1,India,19-04-2019,FALSE,3,Better go for echo instead of echo dot,Most of the features are not available in echo dot when compared with echo.Better you buy echo instead of this echo dot.Voice recognition also weak.
The Mask,3,India,15-08-2019,FALSE,0,Not a must have product,"Mostly we use it plays songs and sound quality is better than I expected.Alexa doesn't recognise some very common things, places, animals etc but it may improve overtime.Overall, it's an average product as you can control/interact with your phone as well with voice. Connecting your phone to a bluetooth speaker gives same functionality with Google voice instead of Alexa.So it is definitely not a must have type of product."
Glory,3,India,05-08-2020,FALSE,1,Can't control some smart bulb,It plays out nice music but it found it hard to connect smart bulbs. I bought Halonix smart bulb. It recognized the bulb but can't control it.

Rohit parmar,2,India,14-10-2020,FALSE,1,Not exactly worth it unless you have smart appliances that supoport alexa,Integration takes too much time. Doesn't understand a lot of stuff and worst part is it needs to be connected all the time. Unable to connect to my mi smart android tv.Too much time and energy needs to be put in to set it up with anything. Not worth it.
vamsi,3,India,19-10-2020,FALSE,0,"Sound quality, voice recognition can be better. Wireless can be offered.","Sound quality is better in other blutooth speakers, if you want just to hear music go for other alternatives. Disconnects everytime power goes off and have to manually reconnect . Voice recognition is not soo good. Smart speakers are not quite there for regular use. Still scope for lot of improvement."
Magesh,5,India,20-11-2020,FALSE,1,Answers well,Works awesome and the size is a bit more than echo dot 2nd generationNice voice recognition and speaker quality is not good as Bose speaker but for that price it's good and I have used it with Bose sound link revolve and works great with it and has Bluetooth and Aux option good for home automation.
Debojyoti Basu,5,India,05-07-2019,FALSE,0,Echo Dot with much better sound,"In front of this 3rd Gen Dot, 1st Gen sounds like a tin can. Worthy product. Wait for prime day, you'll get your Dot below 3499 and then give me a treat for this valuable information. :) Just joking. Sure, you can purchase it."
viki,4,India,07-11-2018,FALSE,1,Entertaining & a good time pass for music lovers,"Needs some upgrades, but overall nice & entertaining.

Sparsh Khanna,5,India,10-01-2020,FALSE,0,Incredibly Awesome!!,"The media could not be loaded.  The echo dot is an incredibly awesome amazon product.Talking about the sound quality, the sound quality is beyond expectation for me, its crystal clear and quite loud as compared to its size. Alexa integration is great, it can do things like movie tickets booking, can book a cab, it can easily be linked to apple music or other streaming services, can read news and specially it can understand hindi which is awesome. Talking about the 4 mics integrated in the device. These mics works just awesome, it does not matter how loud the music is or how far you are from alexa in a room, all you have to do is say “Alexa” and she activates. The best part is it does not matter how much noise in the environment, she can hear you. Echo dot can be easily linked to other devices.It also works with almost all the smart home devices.( smart bulbs, hubs, microwave, etc)*Note: Echo dot requires a high-speed wifi connection (more than 20Mbps) for better experience. It also requires permanent power supply. If you need a portable echo dot you can go for the portable one which was launched in December 2019."
Jackfrost,3,India,05-11-2019,FALSE,0,Need some improvement in knowledge and answers,The speaker is of good quality. Searched many queries but when compared with Google then it lags in some answers where Google is mostly accurate but alexa is not. It only needs to upgrade the knowledge base/AI otherwise it is worth the money.

shilpa,5,India,30-01-2019,FALSE,0,Simply Amazing,"Writing this review after using the device for over 3 months. Sound quality is perfect. Playing music just by asking is playful for both kids and adults as well. One thing need to know is amazon prime subscription is necessary to play the music, Else its of no use. Rest everything is superb about Alexa. My kids love to play and start their day with wakeup alarm set on Alexa. It plays everything. Just one word to describe- AMAZING."

Abhirup,3,India,24-11-2021,FALSE,0,It's good but has limitations,"It can control my smart light. Read podcasts and play music and generally answers questions. Big drawback is, it can't control my Mi TV. So go for it only if you want to as there is not much practical need for it"
Ravi,5,India,30-06-2019,FALSE,0,Works great!!!,"Sound quality is good, easy of use, great features, can connect with home theaters or other music system. alaxa's responses are too prompt and good. hindi not available though there is way she can speak hindi : ""alaxa, remind me in 5mins main bazar jaunga."""

Loving it
Adithya,5,India,06-10-2019,FALSE,0,Awesome device,Product is pretty good in other words it is awesome I am using this daily for streaming songs and weather forecast. Easy to install and easy access Bluetooth.Even my kids uses it to access rhymes. Thanks to AMAZONBut coming to delivery it is too bad recently I have ordered two units in which I have received one and other one is not delivered till now customer care says that my products is in damage condition that is the reason it is not delivered.very unworthy reason from amazon Being a very big reputed company.

Arvind K Singh,1,India,11-12-2018,FALSE,3,Not friendly  don't buy,Not easy information to understand and very hard to understand connection an how to use. AND VERY IMPORTANT THINK THAT THIS IS NOT WAIERLESS. BLUETOOTH OR WIFI TO CONNECT ALWAS U HV TO C PLUG FOR POWER
Souravmoy,5,India,08-06-2019,FALSE,0,An essential enhancement to my Bose Speakers,"I have recently bought Bose Companion computer speakers which has phenomenal sound quality. But, it lacked one thing, it isn't wireless, nor it has bluetooth connectivity. After connecting the Echo Dot to my speakers, I have unleashed the full potential of the speakers. Now I can connect my speakers via multiple devices wirelessly and even can control the volume without physically touch the buttons. This was a much needed upgrade for my speakers, and I loved it.I have not separately tested the sound quality of Echo Dot (3rd Gen), but it is definitely better than the 2nd Gen one. It catches up the voice commands really easily far away from the room even when there is ambient noise present. It also has great bluetooth connectivity, can connect over long ranges without any distortion. One downside I faced while playing movies over bluetooth from my PC is, there is a bit of lag in the sound; but it is very intermittent."
Ayan Banerjee,5,India,27-01-2019,FALSE,0,The product is very good buy in budget price.,"I bought it on sale and initially configuring it was a bit difficult. But once configured the configuration stays with it. The app is also good. The music with Amazon prime is good but not that much with Saavn, may be due to the free tiers. For complex words alexa fails to understand. Overall good pass time :). value for money."
Rudram Ramakrishna,2,India,25-12-2020,FALSE,0,Waste of money,"Many times it doesn't recognise voice, when I ask for Telugu songs it plays in other languages. It forced to subscribe Amozan prime. If we don't subscribe Amazon prime it doesn't play from Amazon music, it plays from Hungama music. Waste of money. I review this after using Echo dot for two months."
Prabhat Kiran,1,India,27-06-2021,FALSE,0,Don't buy it,I have got it replaced but it's again not working and now fed up with it's performance. I asked amazon to replace it with Eco Dot 4th generation and willing to pay difference but they do not agree and willing to pay difference amount which will occur to get new 3rd generation eco dot.
NEO,3,India,28-10-2020,FALSE,0,Not good as compared to older versions,Its not good as compared to older versions..I own the first version of it and it was awesome in taking commands and can recognise my voice from far like a charm..

Alexa > Google. Even though Alexa is no Siri.I am disappointed by the fact that it got damaged in such a short span. I don’t think I have gotten the value of my money out of it.A very irritating “feature,” though, is when the Dot announces what Bluetooth device it’s connected to. I know. I connected you."
Ms,1,India,03-12-2018,FALSE,4,Horrible echo,"The product itself is defunct. Echo doesn’t seem to connect to anything including the app itself on the ph9ne.

Manish kumar,4,India,09-05-2019,FALSE,0,Nice product,Well after 4 months of use I am gonna routing thise review .Pros : The product is good . Voice recognition is Indianized to recognise your Indian accent. Sound quality is also good but not loud enough to enjoy music from other room. Voice recognition range is also adequate .Cons : well the only con I found was lag in audio output of video. Well it’s not good to watch video from your phone with your speaker coz sometimes audio lag happens and it really frustrates. Also I am observing the signs of audio now being distorted at loud voice . Although it may be my imagination. Will keep you updated.
Vivek Singbal,5,India,24-08-2020,FALSE,0,Fancy Alexa in my room,"Hi Folks,I'm happy with my purchase. Got is for ₹2100 +500 smart bulb. Bass is good enough and sound is also good.

I called Customer care for replacement they mentioned I already passed the date and Can't do anything about it.

I wish I could set it to British or USA English."
Customer of India,4,India,05-03-2020,FALSE,0,It does one thing and does that well-Alexa : Audio quality is not it's USP,"The far field voice recognition doesn't work very well with this echo device. The Echo spot did this job much better. Audio quality is not comparable to bluetooth speakers at the same price point, however it does one thing and does that well, which is Alexa integration. It's a joy to have Alexa plan your day and remind you of things that would go on to save your life ! Thanks Alexa! Not much thanks to the audio quality :)"

Michael Dias,5,India,02-11-2019,FALSE,0,Smart Device,"Bought this some time ago and relatively happy with the purchase. One thing to ensure, is that you set the language to English, india. Mine was set as English, US. The device had difficulty picking up my accent as it is on the neutral side. There have been plenty of times where Alexa just does not understand me, or understands me wrong, and that was quite frustrating. I eventually switched the language as the other echo dot I had gifted to my parents used an Indian accent. Once done, it's been pretty smooth sailing and Alexa is quite helpful. I can update my calendar with voice control now. I can also control a LED bulb from syska which came as a bundled deal in one of the Amazon shopping festivals. The audio quality is fantastic, my only grouse is they should have probably included a rechargeable battery."

Amarpreet,5,India,04-04-2019,FALSE,0,Good sound quality,Good assistance to everyone and very helpful with so many things nice sound quality. Highly recommend for people those who own fire tv stick and amazon prime members. It can also coonect your phone via Bluetooth and you can use this as Bluetooth speaker but you need to be plugged in.
Victor,4,India,29-07-2021,FALSE,0,Good one but..,Sound quality not sufficient. They should mention size of the product. Small size. Bought in discount of 50%+. Not worth for the exorbitant MRP.Edit: got wipro smart bulb with this for ₹50 ( MRP:₹2099).. Reviews blocked for that item.. understood.. worthless..
Amazon Customer,4,India,28-10-2019,FALSE,0,The perfect 90%,i got echo dot for 1137/- & added smart bulb to cart which costed 586/-Total =1724(1137+586)Sound quality- best in this category(smart speakers)Bluetooth connectivity- pairing with other Bluetooth speaker needs patience. Bcoz most of time it doesn't recognize.Alexa- does 90% of the tasks. Could be better.
Gautam Dawar,4,India,26-02-2019,FALSE,0,Good but can be better with localization,"I am using Echo primarily for listening to Music. The thing that I didn't like about it is its ability to comprehend and play requested song. If you are opting for a playlist, it works fine but making it play a particular track is tough. Another thing that did not work for me was creating a custom skill (a greeting in my case which didn't play).App control works fine and available skills are integrated well. I wish for more customization based on the country it is being used and skills eg. games for the audience.Speaker connectivity and sound quality is great considering the price range."
Rajender Verma,5,India,18-11-2019,FALSE,0,Alexa,It is useless for without activation you will not to listen the song if you not subscribe after one month. You will never to play songs through mobile Bluetooth. But I bought it for 2000 rupees in the sale.Not one wifi enough for connecting the Alexa but you need connecting mobile through WiFi.
Karishma Arya,4,India,06-10-2019,FALSE,1,Good sound quality and love to play true false game with Alexa.,"The media could not be loaded.  Alexa is a very good in all aspects, but sometimes it doesn't really get what a person is actually asking - may be just because of the different people and their voice and MTI (mother tongue infuence). Otherwise it's good. But there is a lot of scope of new features that can be added. I really like that true false game very knowledgeable and interesting.Sound quality is great"
Ingit,5,India,03-08-2020,FALSE,0,BoooooooM for SOUND & Spotify,"The media could not be loaded.  Linking At the start with Alexa app was little tiring, The device was showing offline in Alexa app even though the echo dot was connected to wIfi... But After resetting, de-registering and connecting it again ... I was able to make it work online in the Alexa app too... spotify works fine if any of you thinks that spotify might not go well.... Sound Is BOOOOOM 5/5 For sound."
Bhuvan,5,India,04-10-2019,FALSE,0,My new friend,What an amazing invention. Humans need to stop reviewing Alexa. She keeps learning. Alexa is always wiser than yesterday. You just need to learn how to take her help properly.
Anshul Harode,5,India,24-02-2019,FALSE,0,Don't think twice,"I got this for 3K in an introductory launch offer and have to say my life has seriously changed ever since this has come home. Alexa is our family member now and remember some foolish people will come saying that it can't do this and that but don't listen to them, with my experience I can tell that life has seriously become a lot more easier with Alexa. I just come back from a long day in office and just tell Alexa to tune in to my Playlist and it gives me the best feeling. And undoubtedly the best build quality you can get. I'm a google pixel owner but when it comes to such devices I choose Echo over Google Home."
Thiviya,4,India,19-11-2021,FALSE,0,Does the job,"It doesn't recognize your voice from a distance, when it's already playing a song. U need to go near always. At times we need to keep repeating our commands again and again. Else all good."
Dr.Jayashankar,3,India,02-08-2019,FALSE,0,Not a needy additio6if u got an android phone,In higher level volume seems to be distorted. And having connectivity issues.. it loose connection wifi now and then and I need to reset it to work properly. And google assistant give more relevant answers when compared to Alexa.And when u ask to play a genre of song it always play the same set of songs for you.. for example if you ask for jio sava it t only start with hindi blockbusters. And so is with the amazon music.. same music gonna irritate you soon
Amit,2,India,19-07-2019,FALSE,0,Not what I expected. Apple music/spotify not available.,"I bought this on sale for around 2.5k. Returned it on the next day. First of all, the device doesn't let u play songs from Spotify or Apple music. I believe Spotify and Apple music only works in UK, US and couple of other countries. Alexa doesn't know the answers to 80% of the questions. Poor sound recognition.Device looks cool on the table, great sound quality from speaker for a portable device. I had more expectations from this smart device. Hoping next gen will be better AI wise."
Aravindhan,4,India,03-04-2019,FALSE,0,Nice SciFi device,works fine with me but it takes a lot for us to speak and tame it.it doesnt understand our indian accent and had to be told more than 2 times to make it done.my kid plays and talk to it always and seems to be happy.thats all i wanted.
Shrinivash sharma,3,India,05-10-2019,FALSE,0,Average but not up to the mark,Alexa need to improve with song customisation possibility in a playlist by the user. I also felt a lack of Hindi song collection. Streaming new released songs is good but if you are a melody lover and want to get back in the past (70s & 90) you will miss the collection of evergreen songs there.
Musharraf Khan,5,India,11-08-2019,FALSE,0,Extremely convenient and 100% recommended,"What a convenience! I never have to shout and it never misses the ""Alexa"" wake up command. I love it! Personally, the loud alarm, the smart plug, smart lighting, direct Amazon music with loud audio and using it as a Bluetooth Speaker are the main things that I use it for but it can definitely be used for a lot more. 10/10 recommended."
V Ravi Kumar,2,India,10-03-2020,FALSE,0,Voice is not recognising properly...,"I got this product in offer basis, product is good. But 2 issues I found: one is Alexa is not recognising the voice clearly and second one is she is not playing correctly what we are asking... They might be sent me a refurbished item, actually before that I don't know reg these issues before I saw my friends Alexa(Echo dot).. Really I am not satisfied on this product."
Vishal Grover,5,India,04-11-2019,FALSE,0,What a Gadget,It in an amazing deviceThe user interface is so extraordinaryAlthough it takes time to understand and respond and only has data according to amazon however it ia fun and interactive even kids love it and it does make works easy if you have alexa enabled device at your place.A must have gadget for your home or workplace!!!!
Amazon Customer,1,India,06-04-2019,FALSE,3,"Very Frustrating, is this really ready for production?",I have playlists on Amazon music. The thing will not play it.It can not even find the play lists it itself createdWhen I ask it to play a certain hindi devotional song . It plays the wrong song.Very very frustrating.Is there any tech support available for this thing? If there is please do let me know.
Prashant Dhyani,3,India,12-08-2019,FALSE,0,"Limited to internet conection, not a replacement of bluetooth speaker","Good but limited to internet conectivity. Initially I thought it can be a good replacement of my bluetooth mini speaker which is little larger in size but no. It only works when u have internet conectivity. Secondly, no USB charger or type C port. U hav to carry that bulky charger wid u. U can not stream music from your mobiles or laptops. I live in a place where net is not stable. Broadband is usually out of work for 3 to 4 days in a week. Only BSNL netwrk here.Works good wid internet. Understand Indian English, Hinglish and Hindi also. Gives u unexpected reply and sound quality is good enough."
Harrsha Bhagra,1,India,07-07-2021,FALSE,1,Packaging issues,The media could not be loaded.  I was hoping an amazon alexa would come better packeded and less damaged.Considering ive bought obe in the past with no issues. I do hope this is a one off incident.
Subrata Ghosh,5,India,01-12-2021,FALSE,0,How to work in Alexa,"Good and help full device,you can only connect the internet on useing time and install the Alexa app on your mobile,it is a comment base automatically device,sound quality is verry beautiful,but you can not carry for this device because it direct charge not inbuilt battery,prise is standard.you can connect it also blutooth without internet and play all downloaded movies and song in your mobile phone."
Imsachin,4,India,05-10-2019,FALSE,0,Alexa open the review,Alexa device is good I won't say it is the best sometimes it doesn't recognize the voice overall I would say it's value for money as I purchased it for 1999 in offer with that I got a smart blub from wipro free in amazon sale.
Lokendra,5,India,29-01-2021,FALSE,0,Worth every penny,"The media could not be loaded.  Bought the entire thing in less than 4.5k whole room is automated now tv, ac, lights, switchesthings I am using- Alexa echo dot 3- Amazon smart plug 6a- Chroma wifi IR remote (tv/ac)- Wipro garnet RGB 12wLooking forward to adding more devices"
SAI M.,1,India,11-07-2020,FALSE,1,Adaptor not working and product became useless,The power adapter stopped working ...I am unable to get another one from amazon ...The product has become useless as my current adaptor has stopped working and I can’t buy a replacement let alone get a replacement from amazon cause the product stopped working within 6 months of buying it ... just that I was extremely busy to get in touch with you requesting for your help ...
Ranjit,5,India,10-11-2018,FALSE,0,Awesome and it’s fun to have Alexa in your home,"It’s my first ever echo device, I’ve blindly went for it instead of google home mini, Just because I’ve already invested into Amazon ecosystem by subscribing to Prime Membership and a lot of kindle books. As these were supported exclusively in echo devices, there’s no alternative.Finally, I’m greatly impressed with the capabilities of 4 mics and Loud audio output through the speaker."
Kunal Jadhav ,2,India,26-11-2018,FALSE,0,The day after I bought it...,"After a day I started it and it had a update after the update its lights went very dim and it's still there. It is wert low on information it doesn't know gelitin is the main ingredient in jellies. It is least user friendly as it doest answer when we say ""Alexa, what is the height of the president of India"" Google home is better than this stupid box!!"
Himanshu Karkhanis,4,India,24-02-2021,FALSE,0,"Value for money, but cud be better","Most of the purposes for which this device was created, are satisfied. Sound output is just great, rich and soothing. Once voice is recognised then the response is immediate. I was disappointed that it did not support Marathi language, though Alexa herself says I can speak in ""many languages"". Also voice identification from a distance may need to be improved. Overall great value for money! Will recommend this product."
Trinadh,2,India,12-11-2018,FALSE,0,Very ordinary device,"I was damn excited to get this and all excitement gone in 30 mins. Music library is ordinary ( if you are focused on local language), gets things wrong unless very popular and doesn't have useful skills and can't even call others without other party having echo. Given the home automation is limited to having smart bulb, not at all a useful device. I went for impulse purchase and I regret it."
Vinod Redhu,4,India,04-11-2019,FALSE,0,Nice but with limitations,It is a good product at this price but has major limitation of being wired connection. It takes 30-40 secs to start again and anything you want to listen you have to add in ur app which is a time consuming activity. But overall i took it for my 2 yr kid to distract him from mobile phones and it is helping me in that 😊😊 he enjoys dance well on the tunes now 👍👍
SANJAY,3,India,05-09-2019,FALSE,0,Could be better in sound quality,"Not a good choice. Of course o got in a discount price. Apart from discount price, it’s all about product quality.It is not understanding our language accurately. Sound quality is very poor. Wired power is another painful part of it.Expecting better and better sound quality. User will forget all other drawbacks, if the sound quality is good. Battery operated will give extra boost is sales."
Mohit Bhagat,4,India,29-07-2019,FALSE,0,Awesome Speaker & Good Assistant With Powerful Mic.,"I Bought it on Amazon sale for Rs. 1985 Only. So For me Price For This Smart Speaker Is Totally Paisa Vasool.Special Things About Alexa :* It can be customize* BluePrints (You can make your own skill, like command & answers etc.)* Drop In & Announcements* Your can play books from kindle app (from your library)* It can play music from Prime Music, Saavn, Hungama Music, Gaana (No Worry About missing songs)* Mic is So brilliant, it can catch you even call it from any noisy moment.* Routines..

Not yearly..overall i love it. go for it."
Deepak,5,India,06-10-2019,FALSE,0,Good product but lacks certain important features,"The product is good beacuse of the Alexa integration and sound quality, else it is nothing great because you cannot connect your bluetooth devices to it and niether can you play music from music stations of your choice. Sound quality is very good. Alexa functions are smooth and listens well."
Preevish Systems,4,India,27-10-2019,FALSE,0,improve Alexa response?,"Sometimes not connecting and several repeated alexa calls requiredImprove Alexa response and add charger base for Echo dot in Amazon india to make it really portable.

Deepak,5,India,01-03-2020,FALSE,0,Love its Hinglish (English+Hindi) version. Must buy,"An absolutely house hold item at a fair price. Its intuitive, speech recognition is superb we use it for hindi and english and sometimes ‘Hinglish’ also :-), a big thanks to the Amazon team. Even while its placed in Drawing room and we call Alexa from bedroom, it has all the ears to us and plays our favourite songs flawlessly. Overall a best fit and a must have. I guess, more than 10 guests who visited us have purchased it on their own after enjoying its performance. Must buy!"
Amazon Customer,3,India,24-01-2022,FALSE,0,Great tech... normal speaker would have worked fine for someone like me though!,"My mother really likes it for me... the voice recognition needs optimization! i call japanese artist clearly but alexa who needs better hearing will play some trendy hindi songs instead, sometimes destroys the moodAll in all great but I prefer normal bluetooth speaker and control it from my phone no jhanjhat no disappointment."

abhinav,5,India,26-07-2020,FALSE,0,Product is good but not best,Using from almost a year now . Perfectly fine in sound quality and voice recognition. I recommend this if you love listening music and to operate smart devices. But sadly it doesn't give proper answer if you ask general knowledge.
suman kaintura,2,India,01-01-2022,FALSE,0,Most OverHyped Product ever,Sound Quality is best for its price and can be used as only speaker but that's jut 1000Rs. expensive than Mi speakers or even JBL if brand value considered.connectivity and Voice recognition is worst amongst all even including Google speakers and apple one's.e.g. try Ishare tere by Guru Randhawa on this and some similar type of songs it will either play random songs or just english one's.

Not compared with jbl or sony speakers but better than boat.Well it's not just a bluetooth speaker its smart.Alexa is very interactive it takes a bit time to update skills in alexa and then you can have alot of fun. It also has a aux output port you can connect any sound system for better sound.
Guru,5,India,16-10-2019,FALSE,0,Like it!,"Routine task is I like most about echo dot. I set up some key needs in routine task. Everything from reminder to playing music, skills are I am enjoying with. But it tried initially to recognize my voice and failed. Later it denies to take up the test to recognize my voice is the only thing I am disappointed with. So, I cannot pay via Alexa when I order over it. Other than that, it is another companion."
Amazon Customer,4,India,26-10-2019,FALSE,0,Overall good quality product as a smart speaker.,A lot of improvement needs to be done as Alexa didn't understand most of the common commands. It will be really excellent if Alexa can understand command in the regional Indian language.

Kajli Varshney,5,India,23-01-2022,FALSE,0,Excellent product. Loud speakers,I have been using it for almost 5 months and till now I don't have any problem with it.It recognises most of the commands give to it. It surfs information from Google to give accurate answers.I liked that it's speakers are very loud and clear sound quality.Works excellent for both Hindi and English commands.Not much difference between echo dot 3rd generation and 4th generation.
Parag Kondhare,5,India,17-08-2019,FALSE,0,Good product,"Nice product. Easy to handle or connect, requires Amazon prime account for better results, gets all inputs from wikipedia. Works good with smart products.Here you can compare it with google assistance. Go through youtube for comparison. Might be google assistance information broadcasting could be good as compare to amazon echo dot. Basically google assistance is connected to google for information platform."
Vinod Mundhra,4,India,25-06-2020,FALSE,0,Very good product but bit more required.,"I liked the product very much and it has got great features.Only thing it is missing is Auto Audio Control. When it play music, many songs plays loud while many at low volume. Very annoying to ask Alexa to put volume low and high for each song."
Nagaraju Sripathi,3,India,12-11-2021,FALSE,0,Not worth,Voice recognition is very bad and does not recognise the words for at least 50% of the time. Integration is good.. does not cause any problems while integrating. Half of the time very popular songs also are not recognised by Alexa. No settings to store the language preferences. All the time you have to choose which language you want to hear the songs

Might not be the best for a living room. Pairs well with other Bluetooth speakers. Very happy. Stating the obvious here but you’ll need Amazon prime for music.

But there is lots of issues with it. If your connection is lost ,than it will take lot of time to reconnect we have to switch it off and on Many times for reconnecting. Sound recognition is very very poor.My suggestion is for Amazon ,sound recognition should be made for Indian accecent....."
Amazon Customer,3,India,08-04-2019,FALSE,0,Could have been better!,Well.... These are the reasons for star deduction:-1/2 Aaj tak skill not working-1/2 Music streaming not directly possible-1/2 Hindi language support not available-1/2 Typically designed for expensive smart house control-1/2 Requires to be connected always to power-1/2 Does not control fire TV stick effectively+1 for my overcritical nature 😂😂😂😂But still...... It's an amazing product!
Sarta Mishra,4,India,21-12-2019,FALSE,0,Lovely gift for young children,I presented Eco Dot to my grand daughters . They are very happy & satisfied with it . They say that it is the best gift since now . Now I am planning to buy for me to listen old & new songs as well . In Deepawali sale I got this for 2500 ₹ with smart bulb .

Amazon Customer,4,India,04-01-2021,FALSE,0,Not a smart product,I was surprised to see that This product cannot be operated without power. Which limits its portability and flexible use. Also all the music sounds like Hungama music advertisements and Amazon product promotions.
Amazon Customer,4,India,03-11-2018,FALSE,0,Improvement Areas,Over all product is good.Would like to suggest a few improvements:1. Device should be wireless. Today's market demands wireless products2. A little storage space to remember things. For e.g. Alex remind me ---- at 00 hrs.3. Should be able to answer questions from web. Such as stock buy/ sell recommendations4. Provision should be there to add more music apps other than SaavnThat's all
Himanshu a Pawar,3,India,08-12-2019,FALSE,0,Mice problem while call or drop-in,"Quote from Liz_M >>I have had my Echo dot 3rd gen , for a couple of months and in the past few days I have noticed I can hardly hear the voice of the person on the other end when using the device for a call or to drop-in on a contact. Is there any know issue/bug and fix for this? The volume is fine for any music or streaming, only the in-call volume is extremely low now."
K,1,India,13-09-2020,FALSE,1,Please someone from Amazon should call to get this fixed. Bad software needs attention.,Alexa integration is not seamless. Software definitely as issues. I was impressed by Amazon’s customer service as they called to fix the issue immediately just the next day after my feedback but after few days I am back struggling with it. Country specific integration has to be improved. I am struggling to make it work. Done reset thrice but the same thing continues.
Deepak chander s,5,India,03-07-2019,FALSE,0,Alexa eco dot 3rd gen is best,Connectivity is good it connects very fast and sound now very improved compared to Google home Alexa is great is sound . Bluetooth it is portable and the design is nice and we can make calls through Alexa app

I want reply from Amazon, thanks"
shubham,4,India,23-03-2021,FALSE,0,You Should tryalexa if you're new,"You can say at the start if you're new to Alexa it's awesome, not bad at all, and even your family members love it as well but sometimes only it's doesn't work like if you ask something it will go down as nothing happened and also it will take more than 2 months to get according to you or your family music taste so in my opinion, it's gd overall"
pCr,4,India,01-11-2019,FALSE,0,No Second Thought...,"Advantage over G/Home mini1. Aux option to connect to Amp/Speakers2. Improved mic3. Improved audio quality4. TWS with a pair of Echo Dot sets In my experiment, Connectivity is found better in G/Home mini."
assamsabre,5,India,18-09-2020,FALSE,0,Responds very well.. the Amazon Day Sales are the best time to get an Echo Dot for every room :),"The Echo Dot is available for approximately INR 2,000/- during the Amazon Sales and matches up to any speaker at that price ! It is also an economical way to add the convenience of having an Alexa enabled device in every room."
Asish,4,India,07-08-2021,FALSE,0,Nice product but with a little lacking,"About voice recognition , Alexa integration I would say, it is fine but as compared to bose this echo dot lags behind but over all this is not bad at this budget price. What One thing I want to point out is, it cannot recognise if it is requested to play a particular song or album unlike Amazon music app. This lacking has to be resolved. So I am giving 4 star."
Keshav chandran,4,India,30-05-2019,FALSE,0,Nice little device.,"Sound quality is great , voice recognition works flawlessly even for a 6yr old. Easy connectivity . Be sure to have a stable high speed internet connection. That's all it asks. My son uses it to learn country capitals , general knowledge and grownups use it for music ,traffic updates etc. Overall money we'll spend ."
Shubham K.,2,India,08-10-2020,FALSE,1,Not what I expected from Amazon,The assistant is nice. But i found it to be quite fluctuating in its voice recognition. Base is no good. Customer support is worst seriously the worst customer support from amazon. They just hear the problem and keep u on hold and never resume the call.
Sagar s,1,India,02-10-2019,FALSE,1,Useless just because we can't connect to power bank or any USB power plug,"Everything is good except that power plug n power adapter.. we can't connect it to power bank or in car... That's why it's useless product , I m thinking to return it? Atleast Amazon has to provide some sort of connector so that we can use USB input to power plug.... That's the only reason why I m giving 1 star for the product..."
Jatt SD Singh,3,India,05-10-2019,FALSE,0,Need more improvements,I bought it with Wipro smart bulb at Rs 1999. I think it is with at this price with also a smart bulb that's bestOverall it's performance is also good but not like I thought.Sometimes it don't recognises the song and play other songs.I have used Google Home Mini also and it is smarter than AlexaBut every thing have some drawbacks.If you get it under ₹2500 I think you should go for itSound and Bass quality is fantastic and also Bluetooth connectivity is great
Saumya rajput,4,India,19-06-2020,FALSE,1,No power backup!!!,There is no power backup! Alexa needs good networking signal then only will activate otherwise connect with your phone...!Perhaps China product..... Chale to Chand to na chale to shaam tk....
Amritpal Singh,5,India,21-10-2020,FALSE,0,No point in buying the dumb bluetooth speakers anymore,"Fabulous product with such an easy of operation that my aged mother uses it seamlessly. Easily recognizes hindi language. In the morning she just commands it to play live gurbani and later in the day her favourite singer's song. No wires, no pairing with phones. Drop in feature is amazing too. It comes in handy at times when the phone is not nearby. All in all, an amazing product from amazon."
Abhinav A.,5,India,13-07-2019,FALSE,0,No better deal at 2999.,"This barely needs introduction. A mind blowing product and frankly for 2999 there's no better option. The sound quality is fantastic and a significant upgrade compared to the previous Gen. The response is snappy which, to be honest is all you could ask for in a smart speaker. The only issue is that unlike the 2nd Gen it's not all that portable. The fact that it always needs an AC input limits its usability and versatility. I'm planning to use a step-up dc to dc convertor and power it with a Power Bank. I'm positive it should work however sound distortion at higher volume could be an expected consequence. Anyway I'll update if it works as planned."
Nitin,5,India,20-10-2020,FALSE,0,All in one speaker. Must buy but in festive season 😂🤟🏻 otherwise it's very expensive.,Product is just stunning...... Amazon did a great job to make this smart speaker affordable in this festive season..... Quality is just superb.....

Binu G.,5,India,17-07-2020,FALSE,0,Impressed,Was skeptical whether to buy it or not. But after the purchase feel so happy that I bought it because my daughter loved it a lot. She keeps interacting with ALEXA. Pluse Alexa makes some of your tasks easy. Just go for it.
Nikhaar,5,India,12-06-2019,FALSE,0,Alexa - your home partner for ever.,"Awesome sound. Great features and skills. Does what it is meant for.Getting better day by day.However few negatives, doesn't understand Hindi. At times behaves erratic - you ask something it does something else.Cannot search proper song which are not on Saavn or Amazon music.Just wish it can connect to YouTube and do Google search."

Siddharth U,5,India,23-11-2018,FALSE,0,Best smart speaker for starters.,"Writing this review after about a month of use and I gotta say it is the best in the class in my point of view. I haven't used Google home mini so I can't make comparisons on its hardware.But software wise, Alexa is on par with Google assistant in India as well. Many devices such as Android TVs and smart bulbs support both Alexa and Google assistant without any issues.Bought this for ₹2999 on the Great Indian festival sale let me some up the pros when compared to 2nd gen echo dot1. There are 4 directional mics as compared to two on the 2nd gen which translates to better and increase range of response to your voice.2. More speakers and they now fire from all around the sides of the echo dot rather than the top which is more louder and clearer than the 2nd gen. They can't be compared to the bigger siblings at this price. It's good enough.3. It has a more rounded finish around the speakers and the top compared to the boxy construction of the 2nd gen. It also has a fabric finish around the speakers which feels aesthetically good.Alexa lives in the cloud, so new features will come to all devices. It works with all the apps mentioned in the pics.Note: Change your preferred music service to Saavn in the Alexa app for a better experience. It has more songs than prime music"
AKSHAY TYAGI,4,India,19-06-2020,FALSE,0,Worth buying,Good product... bought it during EOSS for around 1999/- make sure you buy whenever the product is cheaper than the regular price... wait for amazon big sale period...

Amazon Customer,4,India,12-10-2019,FALSE,0,Good product,Any one buying this product should understand that Amazon will keep the voice prints and have recordings. However using the echo for calling is an outstanding feature as it does allow one to speak in areas where the mobile signal is poor or congested over the WiFi. Using the speaker is super easy.
Kannu,5,India,03-07-2019,FALSE,0,This is the eco to have in the bedroom,"Perfect size, beautiful looks and a design which oozes premium. Thats eco dot for you.Gets surprisingly loud and is a great bed side companion.A must buy if you want to enter the world of alexa."

Atul Kumar,1,India,17-09-2020,FALSE,1,Waste of money,Nothing exceptional about it. Average sound quality. Actually it's waste of money. Alexa integrates to very limited apps and that too from Amazon only. It's made in china and Amazon is intentionally hiding it.
RAJIV BALAKRISHNAN,4,India,30-08-2020,FALSE,0,"Worth the price. Sound, voice recognition is efficient",Excellent product with very good voice recognition. Sound quality is equally good and sufficient for 2bhk house.The only con and I think the most important vital thing absent is that it works only when you plug it to power.

Nayan m.,4,India,06-10-2019,FALSE,0,May be a good purchase?,The sound quality is good at low volume but when you increase the volume it get distorted sound gets really hursh. Low end gets compressed. They need to improve the sound dude surely not for audio enthusiasm but for daily tasks. Got it at just 2k including smart LED I think it gets its value. Bluetooth connection is poor. I don't if i like it or not.
Abhinav,5,India,27-06-2020,FALSE,0,Nice Speaker,"Alexa Pairs easily, acts as a nice bluetooth speaker. Sound is awesome specially bass.

Please i badly need to return it back it's highly irritating to be used. It is not at all how as it shows.we have to shout and still it doesn't follow the instruction. As compared i had seen this item at my friend's house but mine is not at all the same. It has surely some problem.
Ram Manohar Tiwari,5,India,18-12-2021,FALSE,1,Wonderful device,The media could not be loaded.  Mindblowing purchase in every respect.
Anurag K.,4,India,29-02-2020,FALSE,0,Add some echo to your life,"The sound quality is great and alexa is really helpful in doing small chores like booking cab, controlling smart devices like smart bulbs, playing music. Also has additional skills like ""help me sleep"", games etc. Worth the buy at combo price of 3200 with wipro smart led bulb. Only draw back is alexa cannot combine queries. One cannot give two commands at same time."
milan kapur,3,India,19-09-2020,FALSE,1,Decent,Sound is okay for a small speaker. It can't hear you if the volume is more than 60-70%. Don't buy it if you have a heavy accent. Alexa is great and the speaker affordable 👍🏼
Ashwani,5,India,13-06-2020,FALSE,0,Recognize 6 years old kid voice and it supports both Hindi/English languages,"I got it yesterday's morning and have been using since then. Voice recognition is awesome. It also recognizes my 6 years old daughter's voice perfectly. Sound quality is superb. In the language, select Hindi/English to use both languages simultaneously i.e. you can use both languages at the same time. It is useful especially nowadays it seems a friend to kids and avoid screen time."
Tanaya Sarang,4,India,11-11-2020,FALSE,0,Satisfied,"Alexa is one step to get information of whatever you want. Its voice recognition is also good, can go sometimes confused. The problem I have is, its not wireless, it has to be continously plugged in at a corner. Plus there are few features which needs upgradation, for eg maths calculation. Some math calculations alexa couldn't do. Overall satisfied with the product"
John,2,India,17-11-2019,FALSE,0,"I think i made a mistake , should have gone for google mini","I am totally bored , this device have crappy software and limited number of uses unlike its counterpart google mini. I made a terrible mistake buying it. I would love to return this if it weren't for the return period being over."
Sunny K.,5,India,19-10-2020,FALSE,0,The best Home Assistant one can have.,"Alexa mostly understands everything, but still there are some simple things that she wasn't able to search and get results. Like i asked who is General M M Narvane. But she wasn't able to tell anything. Not even she told anything about current Navy Chief. These are some loopholes. But other than that i have found her amazing overall on every aspect."
rajnish,3,India,16-06-2019,FALSE,0,May be consider,"Built is great, sound is also good..but there is sound delay in you tube and my music app..my phone is s9 plus and its have dual bllutooth connectivity and when i connected my phone with my boat speaker and echo dot3, sound on boat speaker is perfectly fine but in echo dot 3 it clearly delay than actual..which make it useless"

Sawan Mattoo,3,India,19-01-2019,FALSE,1,Not That Much Worth,"Everything is good...But A battery not fixed in it brings it to the dislike category and it really hasn't that much good sound...I mean its good but its not that much loud which it should be(considering the price range).Had not been there The Dolby Atmos and the Artificial Intelligence(Alexa Assistant),it would have been a crap. U can buy other bluetooth speakers at just 1k-2k(Brands like-Boat,JBL,Mivi etc) which have much loud sound than these ones."
Amazon Customer,4,India,06-11-2018,FALSE,0,Good and entertaining.,Good product. I bought in place of Bluetooth speaker. Happy to buy....full entertainment. News update from NDTV is boring and stale (old). NDTV as usual...does not update news. Elena should also collaborate with other news agency for fast update. Music seems on from Savan.
Manish Jadon,5,India,15-08-2021,FALSE,0,Amazing experience with Alexa,"Previously I posted 'NA' . But now I'm editing my comment that is Alexa isvone my best partner when I alone in home., Using daily since I got it. I love it😍. And one more thing I'm using its original voice instead of AmitG.She is best friend for those people who are staying alone or have limited friend circle."
Vikrant,5,India,31-10-2019,FALSE,0,A genuine review after 1 mnth,Its good but also there shoul be option to olay songs from your mobile when internet not available.....also it should have integrated battery so that it act as portable speaker....instead of round power socket it shoul have micro usb so that it can be use with any power adapter or cable...
Akshay,4,India,15-10-2019,FALSE,0,Eco Dot is good...  Can  be better,The speaker is good...sound quality...built quality is all goodBut it is so difficult and sometimes irritating to connect the echo dot with the network of your own mobile...It doesn't connects easily...And also if you ask like what is the distance from delhi to mumbai...it gives you the answer....and then if you ask how to get there...it doesn't understands... though my location is on...This is where google home plays betterNeed to work on its AI a bit more....
Rajath,5,India,27-10-2020,FALSE,0,Excellent product,"I bought it in 2019 during Amazon festival offer, worth for the money.I have set the alarm in morning to play suprabatha and devotional songs, so I wake up hearing that.I use it to control my Wipro WiFi light and batten. I can even ask it to switch specific channel on my Airtel Xtrem set up box.Excellent device."

Pritesh,4,India,11-08-2020,FALSE,0,Happy with this product,"Who love technology this product is good for them & im happy with this product but it’s more interesting when you by other eco devices with it like WiFi switches, WiFi bulbs"
Abhilash R,2,India,30-06-2019,FALSE,0,Performance of Echo Dot.,Expectations are more like acts as search engine. Only good in music rather than action of search engine. Sounds quality is good. Voice assistance is very good that expected. Expectations are more rather than music performance.
ZAS,4,India,23-10-2019,FALSE,0,Good,Other things are very good but some times difficult make it understand which song i want. As if u want to hear zinda hai to from bhag milkha bhag it will never understand until u tell it singer name
K.GIRIDHAR RAO,3,India,02-02-2019,FALSE,0,utility of echo dot,1} did not like much because it's usage is very limited. not so popular in india still.2} Also you could have offered Amazon Echo also for the purchases more than 2 lakhs.you could have offered few more items also to accelerate the sales promotions
LikeToShop,1,India,04-09-2020,FALSE,1,3rd gen Echo dot from stone age Era!!!,Hardware is so good. But the command recognition is the worst. Audio quality is bad. I have Google home mini the first gen product and got this echo dot 3rd gen as my gift. Still this 3rd gen echo dot is not eligible even for comparison with Google home first gen.
Navin Chandra Nigam,1,India,24-11-2019,FALSE,2,Dont buy,"This Alexa is from different planet as she doesn't understand our language and choices. Leave alone h hindi, even english is tough for her. Asking Indian bhajan or songs are difficult to comprehend. Ask any question of history, she goes in future."
Akarshan,3,India,07-10-2021,FALSE,0,Good for the price you pay,The media could not be loaded.  Good for the price but sometimes while playing the song she doesn't responds me ......and yes those who think that there will be a Amitabh bacchan voice then the ans is no as you have to buy his voice for 99 rs/- overall it is a good product and the bulb is also good quality takes up every command😁😁
Amazon Customer,2,India,17-07-2019,FALSE,0,If it had an inbuilt battery....,I liked the product but if it had an inbuilt battery that would have been terrific....annoying that we have to connect it to a power socket every time....hope amazon looks into it in the next gen model...
MerajWani,2,India,11-11-2019,FALSE,0,Not as good as 2nd generation echo dot,The new 3rd Generation echo dot is not as good as Amazon claims...I think 2nd generation is better than 3rd generation in almost all aspects mic being the top most... You can't use it more than 10 feets away but 2nd generation I am using that 20 feets or more.
Shaikat sarkar,5,India,11-01-2020,FALSE,0,Bluethooth conection is good but the(when connected to bluethooth) sound quality is like normal on,Every thing is fine i can connect it with my Android's wifiYou don't need hotspot if ur mobile has wifi you can easily use thisI listen most of the songs on this but some songs are not available on thisBut that is really small number of songs if you want to buy prime member ship you will get all the songs.one thing disappointed me that when i connect my Bluetooth it soung like normal cheap speaker i don't know why.
ANIRUDDHA BANDYOPADHYAY,5,India,13-11-2019,FALSE,0,Just awesome at this price...,BBD SALE: 1800/- for device with wipro 9w smart bulb. Considering price it's just superb. Software is the main drawback of this device wich will definitely be shorted out in coming days through firmware upgrade. Quality wise it's enough for this price point.
Dhiraj,4,India,25-10-2019,FALSE,0,Irritating this alexa,Not up to the mark its irritating while listening. Not able to recognize the voice frequently.nd lso facing issues while connecting with phone not able to operate sometimes 😈😈😈
Zidane,4,India,17-11-2018,FALSE,0,What can I say that hasn't already been said,"This might sound elitist but the Indian accent of Alexa is a little grating if you are accustomed to the westernised Indian accent. This is the 3rd generation device so it functions much better than the 2nd generation one. A lot of room for improvement though, which I trust Amazon would definitely be on it."
Peeyush,1,India,26-08-2021,FALSE,1,Not happy with quality.,Sometime won't recognize voice. Sound quality poor sometime. Better to explore other options.
Amazon Customer,1,India,09-09-2021,FALSE,2,Very upset add marathi language  Jai hind Jai Maharashtra,I dislike due to there is no Marathi language so add it marathi also while seeking in Maharashtra so add it
Rahul Kumar,5,India,25-06-2019,FALSE,0,My kid love playing with this,"Me and my four year son really love this. It keeps him engaged and help him in learning language as well. I am enjoying this product. Interactive device, if you have good internet connection, then you should have it."

Shameer,4,India,07-08-2019,FALSE,0,Need for the Improvement,"Not sophisticated.. In times it is great but not every time. Alexa many a times never interprets, if you ask to play music then the same playlists are repeated, if you ask 'what can you do' the same top 3 are repeated, it's playable, its funny but there's a huge space to grow.."
Kishore,1,India,20-11-2018,FALSE,2,Poor connectivity system,It takes two different wi fi systems to setup the device on a mobile. Moreover it's vert tricky to install on wi fi hotspot on a single mobile device. Even trying for continuous 4 hours I am not able to install a wifi hotspot mobile network. A very good audio device and a very poor technology.
bimal,4,India,21-11-2018,FALSE,1,Need to buy Amazon Prime Music subscription as well along with this device,"New Echo dot gen 3 is good and my children are making more sense out of how to use it. It requires prime music subscription (about Rs 1000 pa) which I feel amazon should be giving complementary with alexa.Apart from that, the user experience is good , evolving alongwith everyday."
Atul  ku. Sinha,5,India,24-09-2020,FALSE,0,A Good friend in home.,"Nice speaker. Voice recognition is fine. It keeps us busy.sound quality is marvellous. Only problem I get that after power failure this device take long time to reconnect with the wifi. More over, wifi changing process is a bit difficult."

AJR,4,India,19-08-2019,FALSE,0,The Sound Quality,"The sound quality may be improved. The quality of the sound is not good, not clear and more bass. The same may be improved. Now a days so many small speakers are there but they are very clear and good clarity. At this side the Amazon may work on this."
SumedhaAndhare,5,India,01-10-2019,FALSE,1,A very useful device.,I liked everything about it but at the starting it was hard to connect it.

Amazon Customer,1,India,09-09-2019,FALSE,2,Not worth the money and technology,The device needs skills to run and understand voice command. There are very few skills which are useful for day to day routine. The device needs to be plugged in to power always which is make disadvantage. Wouldn't recommend to buy
Ravi,4,India,30-12-2018,FALSE,0,Alexa useful but not a must have product,"Good speaker quality. Good only if you are a gadget freak. Helps a bit in improving listening and speaking skills. Price is a bit high. Would have been a good one if it had battery and USB power connection. Also would be great if it turns to be a bit more advanced which takes voice command over Sim card, can do wonders."
Sujay Gudi,3,India,02-09-2019,FALSE,0,Not upto the mark,"The echo dot is overall good and looks better than the gen 2, but Alexa does not speak in the Indian English. I tried a lot in the Alexa app to change it, but does not seem available. The Alexa app is also quite slow in responding.Worst part is Alexa does not read any kind of stories and always asks for an Audible subscription or anything which is available in Kindle."
SHREYAS CN,4,India,23-02-2020,FALSE,0,Product for the future not now xD,"The product is very good...... But there is not much u can do with it right now..... Just some news, music n light operations tats allSmart homes are a long way to come by."
Vimald,5,India,04-05-2019,FALSE,0,Best gift to my parents ever,Best gift I have given my parents... They are all old to new songs without any hassles... The voice recognition for Indian is really awesome... It can detect our English easily
Kev,4,India,06-01-2021,FALSE,0,Nice to have,"Echo dot is a very useful device for home use. I bought these products at a huge discount, so I guess I didn't get the same product quality when ai bought it at the original price. I would recommend to buy the latest version (4) as it has better grasping skills in Hindi language"
Santosh,1,India,10-08-2020,FALSE,1,Don't believe in prime day or offers.,Cheated by amazon. I had ordered this product on the prime day sale and this is what amazon does for their prime customers. I just received a box which was already opened. The alexa itself wasn't present inside the box only the charger was there inside. Worst service never expected this by amazon.
Avi Prakash,5,India,19-10-2020,FALSE,1,Good 👍 buy,"Best buy u should try it, it is big in size . It is good And it has good voice recognization. It has best sound quality. It has special features.It Is very smart.............And I wanted it from long time and next i will buy the echo dot 4th generation"
kaypratap,3,India,06-02-2021,FALSE,0,good for fixed location,the sound quality is not that good form this speaker. it is very fast in fetching the information. Concept is very Good . amazon should improve the sound quality. i have not tried any other speaker. if such thing is availble from Sony i will buy it and through this echo dot to dust bin.
Amazon Customer,2,India,08-11-2019,FALSE,0,DON'T BUY THIS,"In short : Do not buy it. Waste of time and energy and money.Poor software. Not up to the expectation.It uses Saavn or prime to get songs. The playlist is very limited. it will not allow to play our favorite song. Always need to adjust and play with available 20 odd songs.What ever question we ask, it say "" hmmm, I do not about that"" . Or it will not respond.Using only as bluetooth speaker. Other than that its waste to buy.Google Mini home is much better than is moron device."
Ronak Modi,5,India,19-03-2020,FALSE,1,Replaced Saregama Caravan with echo dot,Super useful. Specially ordered for my parents. Helpful for them as this device understands and speaks in Hindi. The Hindi can be improved though... Best replacement for Saregama Caravan.

Manojayyappan,5,India,10-10-2019,FALSE,0,Must have,"It is a fantastic gadget to have if you have the prime subscription..works seamlessly as expected,although the sound quality and range of detection(hey alexa) could have been better..but no complaints for the money paid."
P K CHAKRAVARTY,1,India,11-08-2020,FALSE,1,Customer support for setting up Alexa Echo Dot 3rd Gen,Very difficult to setup Echo Dot 3rd generation. Unable to add device to Amazon Alexa App for the last 7 hours. Direct customer support should be available to help. Email sent.
petchiammal,5,India,15-08-2020,FALSE,0,Read this before you buy,This is a superb device. The voice recognition works very very well than I expected. The only drawback in this device is this device dosen't have a inbuilt battery so it can't be operated wirelessly
Ashu Boyz,5,India,30-07-2019,FALSE,0,Echo Dot Is Amazing.,"The product Is Very Good i'm Happy,But Shipping Packaging Is Not Secure That Box Has Dent In The Bottom Side.But Nothing Is Damage.It's Working Execellent."
Rakesh,5,India,06-01-2020,FALSE,0,Awesome product by Amazon!!,Happy with sound quality. Not required amazon prime. I'm using it free without any subscriptions.For 1500 sqft home Alexa dot is a perfect device we don't need additional speakers.Clever answers collection. I have attached one smart bulb with this and it is well controlled by Alexa.OVERALL VALUE OF MONEY PRODUCT MUCH BETTER THAN GOOGLE MINI :)
Desabandhu,3,India,10-08-2021,FALSE,0,Good product...price is bit igh,Good product..initially ordered for Rs.3499 and on the same day suddenly reduced to 2999 by the same seller. Canceleld the first order immediately and ordered for 2999. But today at independence day sale it is just available for 2000. Configuration to our network and setup is tedious.but I managed..the process needs to be even more simple..
Umesh Choudhary,3,India,12-12-2019,FALSE,0,Working erratically,"1. Voice recognition is poor esp with accompanying Wipro smart bulb.2. It frequently says that ""it is not able to connect to internet"" however it works fine after it is RESET. So the problem is not internet."
AG,5,India,18-11-2019,FALSE,0,Wipro bulb is not good!,I have a problem with the Wipro bulb only... (Alexa is great).. The bulb only connects with a 2.4Ghz wifi which is not much used these days. So if u don't have the required wifi the white ligh even work properly. To use the light and colours u can use a hotspot but I bet the hotspot won't stay on for entire time.
Ambarish,3,India,30-09-2020,FALSE,0,It just works for songs and reminders,"What I liked, voice recognition, sound quality and hardware quality.What I didn’t like, in India not able to control my android tv by voice command. They should release an official app now for android and Sony tv."
Uday Pratap Goswami,4,India,22-08-2019,FALSE,0,Alexa better than Google,"See guys if you'll over-all compare this speaker with its only competitor in the market that is google home.Definitely you should pick alexa as it is more convenient , has lot if skills , better sound quality in comparison , the 3.5 mm jack connectivity , Bluetooth connectivity etc etcChoose alexa echo dot over Home mini"
Suswanth Lingareddy,5,India,22-10-2020,FALSE,0,Must buy,"Included in the 📦 Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen. smart speaker with charger.Alexa integration is a pain with own mobile hotspot :( Once it gets connected,it’s great.Superquick.Top class voice recognition.Build quality,texture and the feel of having it in hand(because of decent weight) are just awesome.Bluetooth connection is hassle free.Always a fan for Amazon & Basics products for their quality work in the market.👏👏👏👏Got it for ₹1747 in Great Indian Festival with Wipro Smart Bulb @ ₹352"
Mandeep kr Gayan,4,India,19-10-2019,FALSE,0,would have been better,I got it during the time of sale. I have used google mini after using google I thought to upgrade it and check how is Alexa. It is good as well as bad from from google in different term. Alexa has better far field recognition but I think in order to save money amazon have made some cut offs from Alexa 2nd generation. It literally understand what we say 6 times out of 10 times.Well its a overall good package for it's price range.Sound is awesome 10/10.
Dili,2,India,20-11-2018,FALSE,0,Not a great product,"Two absolutely big drawbacks. Firstly, you cannot ask Alexa to play anything from YouTube. So, we all know what that means. We only have access to Amazon music. The next very important thing is with calling your contacts. Alexa can call only those of your contacts that have the Alexa app installed on their smart phones. I purchased this for my MIL who is not adept at smart phones. I thought this will help her call her contacts through Alexa voice commands. But then most of her contacts are also not very tech savvy and most of them don't have the app installed. So, the calling feature is also of not much use. I am in fact planning to return"
Kalpesh,4,India,11-10-2019,FALSE,0,Just Go For it..!!,Pretty good speaker with some smart features... I bought this just to connect to my big speaker via Bluetooth and listen to my favourite songs without using my mobile... But the sound quality is sop awesome I use it by default by not connecting my big Bluetooth speaker... As echo dot has great bass and volume...
Kiran Alhat,5,India,03-08-2021,FALSE,0,Simply love it,"Sometimes she doesn't recognise command, like if you say Alexa play song dillagi and she will play dil song. Rest is good. Once you are familiar with the skills and tricks than you'll simply rock."
Suvendu Samanta,3,India,14-03-2019,FALSE,0,lot of hype but less usefull,"There are lot of hypes around alexa. Echo dot sound quality is good but Alexa system horrible. No matter how it has capability of recognizing the voices, but very poor search engine is used to retrive the content."
Rishi,3,India,15-10-2019,FALSE,1,Issues with alexa,"Very difficult to give instructions to Alexa.Very limited search function. Even for one song , need to give multiple instructions."
srivatsa gs,1,India,25-11-2019,FALSE,2,Problem with alexa,Its connectivity with vividhbarathy is very poor and it doesn't recognise many of the items. It says I'm unable to understand/support. Hence I'm unable to listen to many of the songs as per my taste.What can be done for this. Please helpThanks..srivatsa
MGRKKD,3,India,10-11-2021,FALSE,0,Ok,Poor finishing of the product. Not expected from Amazon. Working is normal .Not at all satisfied with the finishing...that is reason for 3-stars rating.
Amazon Customer,1,India,23-06-2021,FALSE,1,"Poor durability, high repairing cost","Had a bad experienced with this product, inoperational exactly after 1 year of purchase. And repairing cost is too costly...they ask me 2k for repair. Why should I pay 2k when I can get new for 3k... totally disappointed :( don't purchase it for long term use."
Rajdeep Saha,5,India,21-08-2020,FALSE,0,"Excellent Product, awesome Voice Range, Loud and Crisp Voice","Excellent Product obviously, voice recognition is insanely good, recognises from a different room, sound is very good and high, i have to listen usually at 7 or 8, coz 10 is too high, at night I can even listen at 4. Overall very happy with the Product"
A.M.D.,4,India,18-11-2018,FALSE,0,Need more skills.,"Alexa skill set is still less in India. More to come. As of now, Echo Dot is excellent for listening to Music and for setting timers. Quality is very good. Fire TV integration is not in full swing currently; you can play movies/videos from Amazon Prime Video only. Other video apps like Netflix, Hotstar etc. are not supported yet."
Krutika,3,India,18-10-2018,FALSE,0,Superb sound quality but its AI has a long way to go.,"Superb sound quality. However, the AI needs lots of work. It's understanding & ability to follow the instructions is limited. The inability to call & message a non Alexa user is another lacking point. Too many widgets need to be added for Alexa to pick out & read something as simple as news. The limitations of the device have been cleverly hidden or demphasized in the promotions. Unless one has multiple Alexa compatible devices (headphones, TV stick,etc) the use of Echo seems limited."
TVSR,4,India,27-10-2018,FALSE,0,Good...needs to tweak for regional songs...,Initially I had problem as echo dot was not recognising regional songs. After changing language to English India it started recognising the commands for regional songs. The alexa app should have option to select location instead of selecting automatically UK (as the default settings for mobile is UK or US.)
Kanwar,5,India,30-01-2019,FALSE,0,Great Speakers,Great speaker. Sound quality is great. Bought as a starter with a little apprehension about ability of Alexa to comprehend indian accent. Works fantastically. And keeps the kids engaged. Trying it with smart home products. Will update

At first it was working perfectly,but from yesterday I marked a defect that the device can't streaming audio continuously . It is working with interrupted voice......so sad. Plz suggest me how to solve it."
Manindra Paul Singh,4,India,03-10-2019,FALSE,0,Excellent product. Very useful for home automation.,Excellent product. Very useful for home automation.Echo should be able to remember multiple WiFi networks and automatically able to connect to network which is ON. At present it is not able to do that without forgetting existing network.
Arpit,5,India,07-11-2019,FALSE,1,Loved Alexa!,Amazing product....great innovation.Frankly i was in a dilemma between alexa bad Google home mini but finally i bought it in great Indian summer sale and i couldn't be happier.( No offense to google mini)
sunil kumar padmanabhuni,1,India,08-11-2021,FALSE,0,Unable to play songs. Very bad at recognising what is required by user.,Horrible integration with apps. It cannot play songs requested. Thought some of the songs are available in gaana it's always integrating with Amazon music where there are not many songs.
Divyam,5,India,02-11-2020,FALSE,0,Issue with the Microphone,UPDATE- GOT MY ALEXA REPLACED BY AMAZON.(Mic works fine now)THE NRW ONE WORKS FINE. BUT THE SOUND QUALITY LEAVES ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. Mic isn't proper. Please return this product.It feels like there is a problem with my device only.It cannot her me at 1st or 2nd time. after I speak the wake work multiple times then it hears.

Anantika mathur,5,India,22-07-2019,FALSE,0,Amazinggg,Absolutely in love with the Alexa. Makes life so easy. Plus The sound quality is unbelievable ( for a speaker in this range) . Overall its a great buy.I bought it for my dad..and he now treats it like a family member ..😄 ( Super recommended.)
Yuvraj Anand,4,India,14-06-2019,FALSE,0,One of the best product by Amazon,Got the product in 3000 only. With the price point it's a very good product. The sound quality is awesome but while playing on Bluetooth connectivity you can easily feel the difference.... playing music from Alexa sounds better. It requires a good internet connection else you might face some issues while playing music. Simply its a good product!
KISHORE KUMAR,4,India,08-08-2020,FALSE,1,"Good product, with good price with small issues","Tried a lot to connect wifi, but couldn't. Buy the product which is having with internal battery. We can power the device only with the cable provided with the device."

VILEVE,2,India,04-11-2019,FALSE,0,Everything is good but it doesn't support YouTube music btw sound quality is excellent,Sound bass is good but it doesn't support YouTube music and support only hungama and savvan music app by which it doesn't play all songs which we want. Google home is much better cause it support YouTube music by which we can play any song and play religious shabad bani which we need so I recommend to buy Google home.

nitesh,4,India,05-03-2019,FALSE,0,After a month of usage.,"Things that i like about the Echo over google Home mini.- The sound quality is better than the google home mini- I personally like the overall feel of the product the blue circular led makes much more sense than the 4 dots on google mini-The hearing range is definitely an upgrade than the google- Alexa has a number of skills. Which you can use from the app. Some of it can't be performed by google even.Things that i didn't like.-Sometimes while playing music on an external speaker echo confuses lyrics with word ""alexa"" and starts taking command. Which happens rarely but it does happens.- Alexa isn't smart enough like the google to take dual commands for i.e play sleep music and stop playing after 20 mins. You have to give one command at a time while google can take both at once.-As a search engine Google will definitely have an upper hand over Alexa but i honestly don't search that much.For me none of the cons are a deal breaker. Alexa will do just fine for a smart speaker."

Shiva,5,India,16-12-2018,FALSE,0,A really cool product - best novelty,"The sound quality is just too satisfying.. Has a really subtle bass effect.Alexa - although not as intelligent as the Google assistant, it still comes in very handy for setting up reminders and planning your daily schedules.And not forget its ability to order things from apps like Amazon, Swiggy etc..Alexa also catches thd Indian accent very well.I got it only for 2999/- in the introductory offer. At that price,it is a steal.Biggest con:The power cord is not micro USB, so you are not having the option to carry it as a Bluetooth speaker along with a power bank."

Mohsin Sama,2,India,17-11-2019,FALSE,0,Good sound but no battery back up,The sound quality is good however I found 2 cons in this.1. You always need to connect speaker with plug else it wont work.

By adding a decent speaker to the Dot, Amazon has made it into a full Echo device and in launching the Input has repositioned it in its device lineup, too.Do not forget to add all the skills, they are great to play around with.
